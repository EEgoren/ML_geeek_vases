It lists the contents of each grave and votive deposit, along with their corresponding registration numbers; (4) the Kamiros index cards, written by Donald Bailey in the 1960’s. These mainly record the contents of graves from the Fikellura cemetery and are organised according to tomb group. All archives are kept in the Department of Greece and Rome. In addition, Reynold Higgins’ Catalogue of the Terracottas in the Department of Greek and Roman Antiquities (1954) has been checked for attributions to the Fikellura cemetery.","Bib references":"Vase

and Melousa. Terpsichore is seated in the centre on a chair to right, playing upon a harp (magadis), which she holds on her lap, bending over it, with her head in three-quarter face: she wears a long sleeved chiton, a mantle around her lap, and a curious stephane. Over her, her name, ΤΕΡΨΙΧΟΡΑ, Τερψίχορα. In front of her stands Mousaios, a youth in an himation, wreathed with laurel and holding in his left a chelys: he stands en face, but looks down at her, leaning against a long staff which has a shoot of laurel at the top and halfway up the stem. Over him, his name, MOYΣAIOΣ, Μουσαίος. On the left stands Melousa, in Doric chiton with apoptygma and saccos, who holds in her left a pair of flutes, of one of which she tries the mouthpiece with her right forefinger. Over her, ΜΕΛΕΛΟΣΑ, Μελ<ελ>ούσα. Above Terpsichore hangs a lyre of horse-shoe form.\r\n(b) A woman in long sleeved chiton, mantle and saccos, standing to left holding up her right hand, between two draped ephebi leaning on staves: the one on left wears a wreath.\r\nLarge style.

Terpsichore is seated in the centre on a chair to right, playing upon a harp (magadis), which she holds on her lap, bending over it, with her head in three-quarter face: she wears a long sleeved chiton, a mantle around her lap, and a curious stephane. Over her, her name, ΤΕΡΨΙΧΟΡΑ, Τερψίχορα. In front of her stands Mousaios, a youth in an himation, wreathed with laurel and holding in his left a chelys: he stands en face, but looks down at her, leaning against a long staff which has a shoot of laurel at the top and halfway up the stem. Over him, his name, MOYΣAIOΣ, Μουσαίος. On the left stands Melousa, in Doric chiton with apoptygma and saccos, who holds in her left a pair of flutes, of one of which she tries the mouthpiece with her right forefinger. Over her, ΜΕΛΕΛΟΣΑ, Μελ<ελ>ούσα. Above Terpsichore hangs a lyre of horse-shoe form.\r\n(b) A woman in long sleeved chiton, mantle and saccos, standing to left holding up her right hand, between two draped ephebi leaning on staves: the one on left wears a wreath.\r\nLarge style.

The locality is indicated by a Doric column, which extends to the upper border of the design. On the right of this Heracles stands, bearded and wreathed, wearing the lion's skin, of which the lower part is caught up over his left arm, and carrying bow (of Scythian form) in left and club over right shoulder. He looks to left at Nike, who, in long chiton, mantle, and twisted saccos, runs forward with a second wreath extended in both hands, as if to place it on the head of Heracles. On the right Zeus stands as onlooker, wreathed, bearded, and draped in an himation, carrying a sceptre with lotos top along his left arm and a winged thunderbolt in his right hand.\r\n(b) Artemis (driving a quadriga) and Apollo. The chariot stands to right, the left hand horse bending its head forward, rubbing its nose against its knee. Inside stands Artemis in a long Ionic chiton, mantle, and hair looped up with radiated fillet, holding in each hand a pair of reins, and in the right a goad. In the background, beside the horses, Apollo stands to right, playing on the chelys; he turns his head to left, holding up towards Artemis in his right a fluted phiale. He wears a long Ionic chiton, a mantle fastened on the right shoulder with a large brooch, and a woollen fillet and wreath; his long hair is looped up behind, with a single parotis; from his chelys hangs a long fringed sash with pairs of lines. At the horses' heads stands a fawn, half seen, looking up at them. The teeth of the horses are drawn in; they have broad collars.\r\nSevere style, with remains of archaism. Purple wreaths, fillet, and ends of reins against the bits. Brown inner markings, edge of hair on face, and marking of lion-skin and horses' manes. Eye in transition type: that of Heracles and Zeus are still archaic, with inner angle slightly open; those in b have dotted disk.","Producer name":"Attributed to: The Painter of Louvre G231","School\/style":null,"State":null,"Authority":null,"Ethnic name (made by)":null,"Ethnic name (assoc)":null,"Culture":"Attic","Production date":"480BC-460BC","Production place":"Made in: Attica (Greece)","Find spot":"Excavated\/Findspot: Vulci","Materials":"pottery","Ware":"Red Figure","Type series":null,"Technique":"painted","Dimensions":"Diameter: 330 millimetres; Height: 54.61 centimetres; Height: 545 millimetres; Weight: 5.80 kilograms approx","Inscription":null,"Curators Comments":"BM Cat.

He looks to left at Nike, who, in long chiton, mantle, and twisted saccos, runs forward with a second wreath extended in both hands, as if to place it on the head of Heracles. On the right Zeus stands as onlooker, wreathed, bearded, and draped in an himation, carrying a sceptre with lotos top along his left arm and a winged thunderbolt in his right hand.\r\n(b) Artemis (driving a quadriga) and Apollo. The chariot stands to right, the left hand horse bending its head forward, rubbing its nose against its knee. Inside stands Artemis in a long Ionic chiton, mantle, and hair looped up with radiated fillet, holding in each hand a pair of reins, and in the right a goad. In the background, beside the horses, Apollo stands to right, playing on the chelys; he turns his head to left, holding up towards Artemis in his right a fluted phiale. He wears a long Ionic chiton, a mantle fastened on the right shoulder with a large brooch, and a woollen fillet and wreath; his long hair is looped up behind, with a single parotis; from his chelys hangs a long fringed sash with pairs of lines. At the horses' heads stands a fawn, half seen, looking up at them. The teeth of the horses are drawn in; they have broad collars.\r\nSevere style, with remains of archaism. Purple wreaths, fillet, and ends of reins against the bits. Brown inner markings, edge of hair on face, and marking of lion-skin and horses' manes.

chelys. At his back and over his arms a rolled up mantle hangs. Behind him follows a rough-haired Spitz dog, with bushy tail arched over its back.\r\n(b) Ephebos wreathed with ivy, walking to right, his right hand on his hip, his left holding by the lip a diota which is balanced horizontally on his left shoulder: at his back and over his arms a rolled up mantle passes.\r\nLarge, fine style. Extremities carefully drawn. Purple wreaths, tuning pegs, and cord of plectrum. Brown inner markings (elaborate), also hair of dog's tail and ruff. The beard in a is unusually treated, as a broad black mass terminating in a small stiff pointed bunch of individual hairs: the short hair on the neck under the chin is indicated by brown dots, and two small dots are drawn on the cheek beside the nostril. Eye in archaic type, with black disk against the inner angle open. Breast in b as half a dotted rosette. Edge of hair in b dotted. Below a, pairs of maeanders set different ways, separated by red cross squares (crosses diagonal): below b, the same (crosses vertical).","Producer name":"Attributed to: The Berlin Painter","School\/style":null,"State":null,"Authority":null,"Ethnic name (made by)":null,"Ethnic name (assoc)":null,"Culture":"Attic","Production date":"480BC (circa)","Production place":"Made in: Attica (Greece)","Find spot":"Excavated\/Findspot: Vulci","Materials":"pottery","Ware":"Red Figure","Type series":null,"Technique":"painted","Dimensions":"Height: 57.60 centimetres; Width: 15.60 centimetres foot","Inscription":null,"Curators Comments":"BM Cat.

Eye in archaic type, with black disk against the inner angle open. Breast in b as half a dotted rosette. Edge of hair in b dotted. Below a, pairs of maeanders set different ways, separated by red cross squares (crosses diagonal): below b, the same (crosses vertical).","Producer name":"Attributed to: The Berlin Painter","School\/style":null,"State":null,"Authority":null,"Ethnic name (made by)":null,"Ethnic name (assoc)":null,"Culture":"Attic","Production date":"480BC (circa)","Production place":"Made in: Attica (Greece)","Find spot":"Excavated\/Findspot: Vulci","Materials":"pottery","Ware":"Red Figure","Type series":null,"Technique":"painted","Dimensions":"Height: 57.60 centimetres; Width: 15.60 centimetres foot","Inscription":null,"Curators Comments":"BM Cat.

type":"amphora","Museum number":"No: 1846,0128.1","Title":null,"Denomination":null,"Escapement":null,"Description":"Pottery: red-figured amphora type B.\r\nThe vase is painted in black glaze with white on the stemmata and added red for the inscription. The figured scenes on both sides are bordered at the top by an ivy-wreath within reserved bands. Below runs a continuous egg-pattern within reserved bands. The amphora bears the inscription Πολύγνωτος έγραψεν. (Polygnotos painted), but since the name Polygnotos was used by at least three different Athenian vase painters, the modern sobriquet of the painter of this vase, the Nausicaa Painter, is retained by scholars to avoid confusion.\r\nOn side A two women, back to back, are represented preparing bulls for sacrifice by adorning them with stemmata (sacrificial fillets) in a nearly symmetrical composition. The woman at the left bends over the lowered head of the bull, which stands facing her. She wears a peplos with an overfold (apoptygma) and a head band; her loosened hair flows down over her back. The woman at the right stands upright, also preparing the bull facing her. She wears a peplos with an overfold and a thick black border that runs the entire length of the peplos. Her hair is held in a sakkos (snood) with a leaf-decorated diadem, and she wears earrings. Like the woman behind her, she is arranging a fillet around the horns of the bull facing her. Behind each of the bulls, a tall tripod stands on a raised platform.\r\nOn side B a group of two women and two men is represented. At the far left, a woman, standing frontally, looks to the right. She wears a cloak over a chiton, and her hair is tied up. To the right of her, a bearded man facing right and wearing a himation lifts his right hand as he holds up a walking stick in his left. To the right of him is another woman, who wears a patterned chiton and a cloak wrapped around her body and folded over her left arm. In her right hand, she holds an oinochoe and in her left hand a phiale. To her right, a bearded man, facing left, stands wrapped in a himation that obscures his left arm. In his right hand he holds a long stick, possibly a scepter.\r\nThe scene on side A depicts the preparations for a sacrifice of two bulls in the context of a choregic festival in a sanctuary of Dionysos. The two tripods, typical prizes for victors in theatrical or musical competitions in Athens, suggest a double victory celebration by a phyle (tribe). The women who prepare the bulls for the sacrifice to Dionysos may be personifications of the phyle, or embodiments of victory, Nike, albeit seen here wingless. It seems less likely that they are ordinary mortal women. They are performing a task typically assigned to young unmarried women (parthenoi) in the sacrificial ritual, namely that of adorning the sacrificial animal with stemmata, special woollen sacrificial fillets. The sacrifice that is about to follow, however, would usually have been performed by men.\r\nThe scene on side B is probably linked to these celebrations and depicts a liquid offering, a libation, about to be poured. The precise identity of the figures, however, remains enigmatic: the standing figure may be Dionysos himself or, perhaps more likely, one of the mythical kings of Athens, patrons of the phylai.","Producer name":"Attributed to: The Nausicaa Painter","School\/style":null,"State":null,"Authority":null,"Ethnic name (made by)":null,"Ethnic name (assoc)":null,"Culture":"Attic","Production date":"450BC (circa)","Production place":"Made in: Attica (Greece)","Find spot":null,"Materials":"pottery","Ware":"Red Figure","Type series":null,"Technique":"painted","Dimensions":"Height: 44.45 centimetres","Inscription":"Inscription type: inscription Inscription language: Ancient Greek Inscription quoted: Πολύγνωτος έγραψεν.

type":"amphora","Museum number":"No: 1846,0128.1","Title":null,"Denomination":null,"Escapement":null,"Description":"Pottery: red-figured amphora type B.\r\nThe vase is painted in black glaze with white on the stemmata and added red for the inscription. The figured scenes on both sides are bordered at the top by an ivy-wreath within reserved bands. Below runs a continuous egg-pattern within reserved bands. The amphora bears the inscription Πολύγνωτος έγραψεν. (Polygnotos painted), but since the name Polygnotos was used by at least three different Athenian vase painters, the modern sobriquet of the painter of this vase, the Nausicaa Painter, is retained by scholars to avoid confusion.\r\nOn side A two women, back to back, are represented preparing bulls for sacrifice by adorning them with stemmata (sacrificial fillets) in a nearly symmetrical composition. The woman at the left bends over the lowered head of the bull, which stands facing her. She wears a peplos with an overfold (apoptygma) and a head band; her loosened hair flows down over her back. The woman at the right stands upright, also preparing the bull facing her. She wears a peplos with an overfold and a thick black border that runs the entire length of the peplos. Her hair is held in a sakkos (snood) with a leaf-decorated diadem, and she wears earrings. Like the woman behind her, she is arranging a fillet around the horns of the bull facing her. Behind each of the bulls, a tall tripod stands on a raised platform.\r\nOn side B a group of two women and two men is represented. At the far left, a woman, standing frontally, looks to the right. She wears a cloak over a chiton, and her hair is tied up. To the right of her, a bearded man facing right and wearing a himation lifts his right hand as he holds up a walking stick in his left. To the right of him is another woman, who wears a patterned chiton and a cloak wrapped around her body and folded over her left arm. In her right hand, she holds an oinochoe and in her left hand a phiale. To her right, a bearded man, facing left, stands wrapped in a himation that obscures his left arm. In his right hand he holds a long stick, possibly a scepter.\r\nThe scene on side A depicts the preparations for a sacrifice of two bulls in the context of a choregic festival in a sanctuary of Dionysos. The two tripods, typical prizes for victors in theatrical or musical competitions in Athens, suggest a double victory celebration by a phyle (tribe). The women who prepare the bulls for the sacrifice to Dionysos may be personifications of the phyle, or embodiments of victory, Nike, albeit seen here wingless. It seems less likely that they are ordinary mortal women. They are performing a task typically assigned to young unmarried women (parthenoi) in the sacrificial ritual, namely that of adorning the sacrificial animal with stemmata, special woollen sacrificial fillets. The sacrifice that is about to follow, however, would usually have been performed by men.\r\nThe scene on side B is probably linked to these celebrations and depicts a liquid offering, a libation, about to be poured. The precise identity of the figures, however, remains enigmatic: the standing figure may be Dionysos himself or, perhaps more likely, one of the mythical kings of Athens, patrons of the phylai.","Producer name":"Attributed to: The Nausicaa Painter","School\/style":null,"State":null,"Authority":null,"Ethnic name (made by)":null,"Ethnic name (assoc)":null,"Culture":"Attic","Production date":"450BC (circa)","Production place":"Made in: Attica (Greece)","Find spot":null,"Materials":"pottery","Ware":"Red Figure","Type series":null,"Technique":"painted","Dimensions":"Height: 44.45 centimetres","Inscription":"Inscription type: inscription Inscription language: Ancient Greek Inscription quoted: Πολύγνωτος έγραψεν.

white on the stemmata and added red for the inscription. The figured scenes on both sides are bordered at the top by an ivy-wreath within reserved bands. Below runs a continuous egg-pattern within reserved bands. The amphora bears the inscription Πολύγνωτος έγραψεν. (Polygnotos painted), but since the name Polygnotos was used by at least three different Athenian vase painters, the modern sobriquet of the painter of this vase, the Nausicaa Painter, is retained by scholars to avoid confusion.\r\nOn side A two women, back to back, are represented preparing bulls for sacrifice by adorning them with stemmata (sacrificial fillets) in a nearly symmetrical composition. The woman at the left bends over the lowered head of the bull, which stands facing her. She wears a peplos with an overfold (apoptygma) and a head band; her loosened hair flows down over her back. The woman at the right stands upright, also preparing the bull facing her. She wears a peplos with an overfold and a thick black border that runs the entire length of the peplos. Her hair is held in a sakkos (snood) with a leaf-decorated diadem, and she wears earrings. Like the woman behind her, she is arranging a fillet around the horns of the bull facing her. Behind each of the bulls, a tall tripod stands on a raised platform.\r\nOn side B a group of two women and two men is represented. At the far left, a woman, standing frontally, looks to the right. She wears a cloak over a chiton, and her hair is tied up. To the right of her, a bearded man facing right and wearing a himation lifts his right hand as he holds up a walking stick in his left. To the right of him is another woman, who wears a patterned chiton and a cloak wrapped around her body and folded over her left arm. In her right hand, she holds an oinochoe and in her left hand a phiale. To her right, a bearded man, facing left, stands wrapped in a himation that obscures his left arm. In his right hand he holds a long stick, possibly a scepter.\r\nThe scene on side A depicts the preparations for a sacrifice of two bulls in the context of a choregic festival in a sanctuary of Dionysos. The two tripods, typical prizes for victors in theatrical or musical competitions in Athens, suggest a double victory celebration by a phyle (tribe). The women who prepare the bulls for the sacrifice to Dionysos may be personifications of the phyle, or embodiments of victory, Nike, albeit seen here wingless. It seems less likely that they are ordinary mortal women. They are performing a task typically assigned to young unmarried women (parthenoi) in the sacrificial ritual, namely that of adorning the sacrificial animal with stemmata, special woollen sacrificial fillets. The sacrifice that is about to follow, however, would usually have been performed by men.\r\nThe scene on side B is probably linked to these celebrations and depicts a liquid offering, a libation, about to be poured. The precise identity of the figures, however, remains enigmatic: the standing figure may be Dionysos himself or, perhaps more likely, one of the mythical kings of Athens, patrons of the phylai.","Producer name":"Attributed to: The Nausicaa Painter","School\/style":null,"State":null,"Authority":null,"Ethnic name (made by)":null,"Ethnic name (assoc)":null,"Culture":"Attic","Production date":"450BC (circa)","Production place":"Made in: Attica (Greece)","Find spot":null,"Materials":"pottery","Ware":"Red Figure","Type series":null,"Technique":"painted","Dimensions":"Height: 44.45 centimetres","Inscription":"Inscription type: inscription Inscription language: Ancient Greek Inscription quoted: Πολύγνωτος έγραψεν.

The woman at the left bends over the lowered head of the bull, which stands facing her. She wears a peplos with an overfold (apoptygma) and a head band; her loosened hair flows down over her back. The woman at the right stands upright, also preparing the bull facing her. She wears a peplos with an overfold and a thick black border that runs the entire length of the peplos. Her hair is held in a sakkos (snood) with a leaf-decorated diadem, and she wears earrings. Like the woman behind her, she is arranging a fillet around the horns of the bull facing her. Behind each of the bulls, a tall tripod stands on a raised platform.\r\nOn side B a group of two women and two men is represented. At the far left, a woman, standing frontally, looks to the right. She wears a cloak over a chiton, and her hair is tied up. To the right of her, a bearded man facing right and wearing a himation lifts his right hand as he holds up a walking stick in his left. To the right of him is another woman, who wears a patterned chiton and a cloak wrapped around her body and folded over her left arm. In her right hand, she holds an oinochoe and in her left hand a phiale. To her right, a bearded man, facing left, stands wrapped in a himation that obscures his left arm. In his right hand he holds a long stick, possibly a scepter.\r\nThe scene on side A depicts the preparations for a sacrifice of two bulls in the context of a choregic festival in a sanctuary of Dionysos. The two tripods, typical prizes for victors in theatrical or musical competitions in Athens, suggest a double victory celebration by a phyle (tribe). The women who prepare the bulls for the sacrifice to Dionysos may be personifications of the phyle, or embodiments of victory, Nike, albeit seen here wingless. It seems less likely that they are ordinary mortal women. They are performing a task typically assigned to young unmarried women (parthenoi) in the sacrificial ritual, namely that of adorning the sacrificial animal with stemmata, special woollen sacrificial fillets. The sacrifice that is about to follow, however, would usually have been performed by men.\r\nThe scene on side B is probably linked to these celebrations and depicts a liquid offering, a libation, about to be poured. The precise identity of the figures, however, remains enigmatic: the standing figure may be Dionysos himself or, perhaps more likely, one of the mythical kings of Athens, patrons of the phylai.","Producer name":"Attributed to: The Nausicaa Painter","School\/style":null,"State":null,"Authority":null,"Ethnic name (made by)":null,"Ethnic name (assoc)":null,"Culture":"Attic","Production date":"450BC (circa)","Production place":"Made in: Attica (Greece)","Find spot":null,"Materials":"pottery","Ware":"Red Figure","Type series":null,"Technique":"painted","Dimensions":"Height: 44.45 centimetres","Inscription":"Inscription type: inscription Inscription language: Ancient Greek Inscription quoted: Πολύγνωτος έγραψεν.

The precise identity of the figures, however, remains enigmatic: the standing figure may be Dionysos himself or, perhaps more likely, one of the mythical kings of Athens, patrons of the phylai.","Producer name":"Attributed to: The Nausicaa Painter","School\/style":null,"State":null,"Authority":null,"Ethnic name (made by)":null,"Ethnic name (assoc)":null,"Culture":"Attic","Production date":"450BC (circa)","Production place":"Made in: Attica (Greece)","Find spot":null,"Materials":"pottery","Ware":"Red Figure","Type series":null,"Technique":"painted","Dimensions":"Height: 44.45 centimetres","Inscription":"Inscription type: inscription Inscription language: Ancient Greek Inscription quoted: Πολύγνωτος έγραψεν.

On the body, between the two rows of designs, vine-wreath; below, all round, maeander.\r\nOn the shoulder: (a) Female head to the front, issuing from a flower which spreads out in luxuriant tendrils and blossoms each side; the head has curly hair, radiated fillet and necklace, and is painted white with yellow markings, (b) Female head to left, issuing from a flower; hair tied in a bunch, open cap radiated in front, earrings, and necklace; on either side, tendrils.\r\nOn the body, two rows of designs: \r\n1. (a) Meeting of Pelops and Oinomaos at the altar of Zeus: In the centre is the altar painted white; behind it, a stele with white abacus, down the front of which is painted in white: ΔΙΟΣ, '(the altar) of Zeus.' Above the stele is a youthful head slightly inclined to left, with thick curls and eyes closed; above it is incised: ΠΕΡΙΦΑΣ, Περίφας. On the right of the altar is Oinomaos to left, holding out a phiale in right hand over the altar, as if pouring a libation; above him is incised: ΟΙΝΟΜΑΟΣ, Οινόμαος. He is bearded, and wears a white crested helmet, short bordered chiton with band on which four swans are embroidered, white linen cuirass with shoulder-straps and a floriated cross on the breast, belt with egg-moulding, ornamented with patterns in yellow, bordered chlamys fastened with a fibula in front, and endromides with tops turned over. He holds a spear or sceptre in left hand, and a sword is slung at his left side; the lower part of his figure has been repainted. On the left of the altar is Pelops standing to right, with left leg crossed over right, and right hand on hip; above him is incised: ΡΕΛΟΨ, Πελοψ. He is beardless, and wears a Lydian tiara ornamented with spirals and white ridged crest and lappets, short embroidered chiton and under-garment, with long sleeves, ornamented with palmettes and rings respectively; bordered chlamys fastened in front with a fibula, girdle and cross-belt ornamented with white studs, and endromides with buttons and tops turned over. A sword is slung at his side, and in his left hand are two spears; behind him hang a white pilos and a sword. On the left is Sterope to right, looking back at Hippodameia, whom she leads forward, holding her left wrist with right hand; she has white hair, and wears long chiton, bordered himation veiling her head, and shoes; in her left hand is a fan. Hippodameia has long curls, and wears a beaded ampyx ornamented with palmettes, earrings, double necklace, bracelets, and sandals; long girt embroidered chiton with looped-up sleeves and apoptygma, down the front of which is a broad stripe of lozenge-pattern with white dots; bordered himation at the back veiling her head, which she draws forward in right hand. Above her is incised: ΗΠΠΟΔΑΜΕΙΑ, Ίπποδάμεια. Between these two figures is a youthful head with curly hair and a Phrygian cap with lappets, looking downwards to right, above which is incised ΠΕΛΑΠ…, Πελάγ[ων]. On the right is Myrtilos moving away and looking back, beardless, with curly hair and bordered chlamys fastened with a fibula in front, in left hand a wreath, in right a wand; the lower part of his figure has been repainted; above him is incised ΜΥΡΤΙΛΟΣ, Μύρτίλος. On the extreme right is Aphrodite, seated to left, with hair tied in a bunch, open cap radiated in front, earrings, double necklace, bracelets, long chiton with looped-up sleeves and girdle, bordered himation, and sandals; in left hand she holds a string attached to a magic wheel lying on the ground. She holds up two fingers of right hand as if conversing with Eros, who hovers above to left, looking back at her; he has hair gathered in a knot, open cap radiated in front, earrings, double necklace, bracelets, anklet on left leg, in right hand an embroidered taenia, in left a phiale. Above these two figures is incised respectively: ΑΦΡΟΔΙΤΗ, 'Αφροδίτη, and ΕΡΩΣ, ‘Ερως. The ground-lines are indicated as usual. The scene apparently takes place before the palace of Oinomaos, represented by the pilos and sword hanging up, and by the two heads, which are probably those of former suitors slain by Oinomaos.\r\n(b) In the centre is a female figure to left, with left leg crossed over right, leaning on a white stele; she has hair in a bunch, open cap radiated in front, earrings, double necklace, bracelets, long girt chiton, himation, and sandals, in right hand a wreath, in left an embroidered taenia. Before her is a youth seated to right, with drapery under him and myrtle-wreath, in right hand a staff, in left a phiale containing fruit; between them is a taenia, and above, an iynx flying to right with an embroidered taenia in its claws. On the left is a female figure moving to right, with hair in a bunch, open beaded cap, earrings, double necklace, bracelets, long girt chiton, and shoes, in right hand a bunch of grapes, in left a large flower. She looks back at a youth to right, with left foot raised on a rock, myrtle-wreath, and drapery over left arm, holding out a wreath in both hands; above is a rosette. On the right is a youth to the front with myrtle-wreath, chlamys over arms, staff in left hand and mirror in right, looking back at a female figure to left, who holds out a white alabastron to him in right hand; she has hair tied in a bunch, open cap radiated in front, earrings, double necklace, bracelets, long girt chiton, and sandals, in left hand a wreath, over her right arm a white taenia; above are two rosettes. The ground-lines are indicated.\r\n2. On the lower row, a frieze representing offerings at a tomb: In the centre is an altar on a base with two bands of white dots; above it is an Ionic capital on which stands a fluted hydria; above hangs a white taenia with dots. On the right is a female figure approaching, about to place an embroidered taenia on the hydria; she wears bracelets; her figure is almost entirely repainted. Next is a youth seated to right, looking back, entirely repainted; behind him, a rosette and a flower; before him, a white taenia. Next, a similar youth to left, wearing a wreath, all but the top of his head repainted; behind him, a star of nine points. Next are two female figures, almost entirely repainted; the first to left with radiated cap and sandals, holding out an embroidered taenia in right hand; the other seated to the front, holding a fan in right hand and a box in left. Further to the right are four figures moving to left; first, Eros running, looking back, with embroidered taenia in right hand and phiale in left, mostly repainted. Next is a female figure with hair gathered in a radiated opisthosphendone, earrings, double necklace, long chiton, and himation in which left hand is muffled, in right band a large branch with fruit; before her is a laurel-branch. Next, a youth looking back, with myrtle-wreath and drapery over arms, in right hand a mirror; on his left hand is perched an iynx, and before him is a flower; his figure is slightly restored. Behind him is a female figure running, with bracelets, long chiton, sandals, and wreath in left hand, mostly repainted; before her, a rosette and a plant. Next to these is a female figure moving to right, with hair tied in a bunch, open cap radiated in front, earrings, necklace, bracelets, long girt chiton, himation over left arm held up in right hand, and sandals; on her left hand is a goose (?) to left. Before her is a female figure looking back, similarly attired, with himation round body and wreath in right hand from which hangs a white taenia, in left a pyxis and embroidered taenia. Lastly, a female figure seated to left looking back at the altar, with hair gathered in a radiated opisthosphendone, earrings, double necklace, bracelets, long chiton, himation, and sandals, in right hand an Apulian sistrum, in left a box with open lid, and an embroidered taenia. The ground-lines are indicated here and there, with occasional flowers.","Producer name":"Attributed to: The Varrese Painter","School\/style":null,"State":null,"Authority":null,"Ethnic name (made by)":null,"Ethnic name (assoc)":null,"Culture":"Apulian (Greek)","Production date":"360BC-330BC","Production place":"Made in: Puglia","Find spot":"Excavated\/Findspot: Ruvo (Puglia)","Materials":"pottery","Ware":"Red Figure","Type series":null,"Technique":"painted","Dimensions":"Height: 96 centimetres; Weight: 7 kilograms Approx ; Width: 36 centimetres","Inscription":null,"Curators Comments":"BM Cat.

(a) Meeting of Pelops and Oinomaos at the altar of Zeus: In the centre is the altar painted white; behind it, a stele with white abacus, down the front of which is painted in white: ΔΙΟΣ, '(the altar) of Zeus.' Above the stele is a youthful head slightly inclined to left, with thick curls and eyes closed; above it is incised: ΠΕΡΙΦΑΣ, Περίφας. On the right of the altar is Oinomaos to left, holding out a phiale in right hand over the altar, as if pouring a libation; above him is incised: ΟΙΝΟΜΑΟΣ, Οινόμαος. He is bearded, and wears a white crested helmet, short bordered chiton with band on which four swans are embroidered, white linen cuirass with shoulder-straps and a floriated cross on the breast, belt with egg-moulding, ornamented with patterns in yellow, bordered chlamys fastened with a fibula in front, and endromides with tops turned over. He holds a spear or sceptre in left hand, and a sword is slung at his left side; the lower part of his figure has been repainted. On the left of the altar is Pelops standing to right, with left leg crossed over right, and right hand on hip; above him is incised: ΡΕΛΟΨ, Πελοψ. He is beardless, and wears a Lydian tiara ornamented with spirals and white ridged crest and lappets, short embroidered chiton and under-garment, with long sleeves, ornamented with palmettes and rings respectively; bordered chlamys fastened in front with a fibula, girdle and cross-belt ornamented with white studs, and endromides with buttons and tops turned over. A sword is slung at his side, and in his left hand are two spears; behind him hang a white pilos and a sword. On the left is Sterope to right, looking back at Hippodameia, whom she leads forward, holding her left wrist with right hand; she has white hair, and wears long chiton, bordered himation veiling her head, and shoes; in her left hand is a fan. Hippodameia has long curls, and wears a beaded ampyx ornamented with palmettes, earrings, double necklace, bracelets, and sandals; long girt embroidered chiton with looped-up sleeves and apoptygma, down the front of which is a broad stripe of lozenge-pattern with white dots; bordered himation at the back veiling her head, which she draws forward in right hand. Above her is incised: ΗΠΠΟΔΑΜΕΙΑ, Ίπποδάμεια. Between these two figures is a youthful head with curly hair and a Phrygian cap with lappets, looking downwards to right, above which is incised ΠΕΛΑΠ…, Πελάγ[ων]. On the right is Myrtilos moving away and looking back, beardless, with curly hair and bordered chlamys fastened with a fibula in front, in left hand a wreath, in right a wand; the lower part of his figure has been repainted; above him is incised ΜΥΡΤΙΛΟΣ, Μύρτίλος. On the extreme right is Aphrodite, seated to left, with hair tied in a bunch, open cap radiated in front, earrings, double necklace, bracelets, long chiton with looped-up sleeves and girdle, bordered himation, and sandals; in left hand she holds a string attached to a magic wheel lying on the ground. She holds up two fingers of right hand as if conversing with Eros, who hovers above to left, looking back at her; he has hair gathered in a knot, open cap radiated in front, earrings, double necklace, bracelets, anklet on left leg, in right hand an embroidered taenia, in left a phiale. Above these two figures is incised respectively: ΑΦΡΟΔΙΤΗ, 'Αφροδίτη, and ΕΡΩΣ, ‘Ερως. The ground-lines are indicated as usual. The scene apparently takes place before the palace of Oinomaos, represented by the pilos and sword hanging up, and by the two heads, which are probably those of former suitors slain by Oinomaos.\r\n(b) In the centre is a female figure to left, with left leg crossed over right, leaning on a white stele; she has hair in a bunch, open cap radiated in front, earrings, double necklace, bracelets, long girt chiton, himation, and sandals, in right hand a wreath, in left an embroidered taenia. Before her is a youth seated to right, with drapery under him and myrtle-wreath, in right hand a staff, in left a phiale containing fruit; between them is a taenia, and above, an iynx flying to right with an embroidered taenia in its claws. On the left is a female figure moving to right, with hair in a bunch, open beaded cap, earrings, double necklace, bracelets, long girt chiton, and shoes, in right hand a bunch of grapes, in left a large flower. She looks back at a youth to right, with left foot raised on a rock, myrtle-wreath, and drapery over left arm, holding out a wreath in both hands; above is a rosette. On the right is a youth to the front with myrtle-wreath, chlamys over arms, staff in left hand and mirror in right, looking back at a female figure to left, who holds out a white alabastron to him in right hand; she has hair tied in a bunch, open cap radiated in front, earrings, double necklace, bracelets, long girt chiton, and sandals, in left hand a wreath, over her right arm a white taenia; above are two rosettes. The ground-lines are indicated.\r\n2. On the lower row, a frieze representing offerings at a tomb: In the centre is an altar on a base with two bands of white dots; above it is an Ionic capital on which stands a fluted hydria; above hangs a white taenia with dots. On the right is a female figure approaching, about to place an embroidered taenia on the hydria; she wears bracelets; her figure is almost entirely repainted. Next is a youth seated to right, looking back, entirely repainted; behind him, a rosette and a flower; before him, a white taenia. Next, a similar youth to left, wearing a wreath, all but the top of his head repainted; behind him, a star of nine points. Next are two female figures, almost entirely repainted; the first to left with radiated cap and sandals, holding out an embroidered taenia in right hand; the other seated to the front, holding a fan in right hand and a box in left. Further to the right are four figures moving to left; first, Eros running, looking back, with embroidered taenia in right hand and phiale in left, mostly repainted. Next is a female figure with hair gathered in a radiated opisthosphendone, earrings, double necklace, long chiton, and himation in which left hand is muffled, in right band a large branch with fruit; before her is a laurel-branch. Next, a youth looking back, with myrtle-wreath and drapery over arms, in right hand a mirror; on his left hand is perched an iynx, and before him is a flower; his figure is slightly restored. Behind him is a female figure running, with bracelets, long chiton, sandals, and wreath in left hand, mostly repainted; before her, a rosette and a plant. Next to these is a female figure moving to right, with hair tied in a bunch, open cap radiated in front, earrings, necklace, bracelets, long girt chiton, himation over left arm held up in right hand, and sandals; on her left hand is a goose (?) to left.

accessories of white and yellow; carefully executed. Round the lip, vine-wreath; on the neck, each side, palmettes and a row of dots; under the handles, palmettes. On the shoulder, (a) flowers, (b) rosettes and dots; below, egg-moulding. On the body, between the two rows of designs, vine-wreath; below, all round, maeander.\r\nOn the shoulder: (a) Female head to the front, issuing from a flower which spreads out in luxuriant tendrils and blossoms each side; the head has curly hair, radiated fillet and necklace, and is painted white with yellow markings, (b) Female head to left, issuing from a flower; hair tied in a bunch, open cap radiated in front, earrings, and necklace; on either side, tendrils.\r\nOn the body, two rows of designs: \r\n1. (a) Meeting of Pelops and Oinomaos at the altar of Zeus: In the centre is the altar painted white; behind it, a stele with white abacus, down the front of which is painted in white: ΔΙΟΣ, '(the altar) of Zeus.' Above the stele is a youthful head slightly inclined to left, with thick curls and eyes closed; above it is incised: ΠΕΡΙΦΑΣ, Περίφας. On the right of the altar is Oinomaos to left, holding out a phiale in right hand over the altar, as if pouring a libation; above him is incised: ΟΙΝΟΜΑΟΣ, Οινόμαος. He is bearded, and wears a white crested helmet, short bordered chiton with band on which four swans are embroidered, white linen cuirass with shoulder-straps and a floriated cross on the breast, belt with egg-moulding, ornamented with patterns in yellow, bordered chlamys fastened with a fibula in front, and endromides with tops turned over. He holds a spear or sceptre in left hand, and a sword is slung at his left side; the lower part of his figure has been repainted. On the left of the altar is Pelops standing to right, with left leg crossed over right, and right hand on hip; above him is incised: ΡΕΛΟΨ, Πελοψ. He is beardless, and wears a Lydian tiara ornamented with spirals and white ridged crest and lappets, short embroidered chiton and under-garment, with long sleeves, ornamented with palmettes and rings respectively; bordered chlamys fastened in front with a fibula, girdle and cross-belt ornamented with white studs, and endromides with buttons and tops turned over. A sword is slung at his side, and in his left hand are two spears; behind him hang a white pilos and a sword. On the left is Sterope to right, looking back at Hippodameia, whom she leads forward, holding her left wrist with right hand; she has white hair, and wears long chiton, bordered himation veiling her head, and shoes; in her left hand is a fan. Hippodameia has long curls, and wears a beaded ampyx ornamented with palmettes, earrings, double necklace, bracelets, and sandals; long girt embroidered chiton with looped-up sleeves and apoptygma, down the front of which is a broad stripe of lozenge-pattern with white dots; bordered himation at the back veiling her head, which she draws forward in right hand. Above her is incised: ΗΠΠΟΔΑΜΕΙΑ, Ίπποδάμεια. Between these two figures is a youthful head with curly hair and a Phrygian cap with lappets, looking downwards to right, above which is incised ΠΕΛΑΠ…, Πελάγ[ων]. On the right is Myrtilos moving away and looking back, beardless, with curly hair and bordered chlamys fastened with a fibula in front, in left hand a wreath, in right a wand; the lower part of his figure has been repainted; above him is incised ΜΥΡΤΙΛΟΣ, Μύρτίλος. On the extreme right is Aphrodite, seated to left, with hair tied in a bunch, open cap radiated in front, earrings, double necklace, bracelets, long chiton with looped-up sleeves and girdle, bordered himation, and sandals; in left hand she holds a string attached to a magic wheel lying on the ground. She holds up two fingers of right hand as if conversing with Eros, who hovers above to left, looking back at her; he has hair gathered in a knot, open cap radiated in front, earrings, double necklace, bracelets, anklet on left leg, in right hand an embroidered taenia, in left a phiale. Above these two figures is incised respectively: ΑΦΡΟΔΙΤΗ, 'Αφροδίτη, and ΕΡΩΣ, ‘Ερως. The ground-lines are indicated as usual. The scene apparently takes place before the palace of Oinomaos, represented by the pilos and sword hanging up, and by the two heads, which are probably those of former suitors slain by Oinomaos.\r\n(b) In the centre is a female figure to left, with left leg crossed over right, leaning on a white stele; she has hair in a bunch, open cap radiated in front, earrings, double necklace, bracelets, long girt chiton, himation, and sandals, in right hand a wreath, in left an embroidered taenia. Before her is a youth seated to right, with drapery under him and myrtle-wreath, in right hand a staff, in left a phiale containing fruit; between them is a taenia, and above, an iynx flying to right with an embroidered taenia in its claws. On the left is a female figure moving to right, with hair in a bunch, open beaded cap, earrings, double necklace, bracelets, long girt chiton, and shoes, in right hand a bunch of grapes, in left a large flower. She looks back at a youth to right, with left foot raised on a rock, myrtle-wreath, and drapery over left arm, holding out a wreath in both hands; above is a rosette. On the right is a youth to the front with myrtle-wreath, chlamys over arms, staff in left hand and mirror in right, looking back at a female figure to left, who holds out a white alabastron to him in right hand; she has hair tied in a bunch, open cap radiated in front, earrings, double necklace, bracelets, long girt chiton, and sandals, in left hand a wreath, over her right arm a white taenia; above are two rosettes. The ground-lines are indicated.\r\n2. On the lower row, a frieze representing offerings at a tomb: In the centre is an altar on a base with two bands of white dots; above it is an Ionic capital on which stands a fluted hydria; above hangs a white taenia with dots. On the right is a female figure approaching, about to place an embroidered taenia on the hydria; she wears bracelets; her figure is almost entirely repainted. Next is a youth seated to right, looking back, entirely repainted; behind him, a rosette and a flower; before him, a white taenia. Next, a similar youth to left, wearing a wreath, all but the top of his head repainted; behind him, a star of nine points. Next are two female figures, almost entirely repainted; the first to left with radiated cap and sandals, holding out an embroidered taenia in right hand; the other seated to the front, holding a fan in right hand and a box in left. Further to the right are four figures moving to left; first, Eros running, looking back, with embroidered taenia in right hand and phiale in left, mostly repainted. Next is a female figure with hair gathered in a radiated opisthosphendone, earrings, double necklace, long chiton, and himation in which left hand is muffled, in right band a large branch with fruit; before her is a laurel-branch. Next, a youth looking back, with myrtle-wreath and drapery over arms, in right hand a mirror; on his left hand is perched an iynx, and before him is a flower; his figure is slightly restored. Behind him is a female figure running, with bracelets, long chiton, sandals, and wreath in left hand, mostly repainted; before her, a rosette and a plant. Next to these is a female figure moving to right, with hair tied in a bunch, open cap radiated in front, earrings, necklace, bracelets, long girt chiton, himation over left arm held up in right hand, and sandals; on her left hand is a goose (?) to left. Before her is a female figure looking back, similarly attired, with himation round body and wreath in right hand from which hangs a white taenia, in left a pyxis and embroidered taenia. Lastly, a female figure seated to left looking back at the altar, with hair gathered in a radiated opisthosphendone, earrings, double necklace, bracelets, long chiton, himation, and sandals, in right hand an Apulian sistrum, in left a box with open lid, and an embroidered taenia. The ground-lines are indicated here and there, with occasional flowers.","Producer name":"Attributed to: The Varrese Painter","School\/style":null,"State":null,"Authority":null,"Ethnic name (made by)":null,"Ethnic name (assoc)":null,"Culture":"Apulian (Greek)","Production date":"360BC-330BC","Production place":"Made in: Puglia","Find spot":"Excavated\/Findspot: Ruvo (Puglia)","Materials":"pottery","Ware":"Red Figure","Type series":null,"Technique":"painted","Dimensions":"Height: 96 centimetres; Weight: 7 kilograms Approx ; Width: 36 centimetres","Inscription":null,"Curators Comments":"BM Cat.

He is beardless, and wears a Lydian tiara ornamented with spirals and white ridged crest and lappets, short embroidered chiton and under-garment, with long sleeves, ornamented with palmettes and rings respectively; bordered chlamys fastened in front with a fibula, girdle and cross-belt ornamented with white studs, and endromides with buttons and tops turned over. A sword is slung at his side, and in his left hand are two spears; behind him hang a white pilos and a sword. On the left is Sterope to right, looking back at Hippodameia, whom she leads forward, holding her left wrist with right hand; she has white hair, and wears long chiton, bordered himation veiling her head, and shoes; in her left hand is a fan. Hippodameia has long curls, and wears a beaded ampyx ornamented with palmettes, earrings, double necklace, bracelets, and sandals; long girt embroidered chiton with looped-up sleeves and apoptygma, down the front of which is a broad stripe of lozenge-pattern with white dots; bordered himation at the back veiling her head, which she draws forward in right hand. Above her is incised: ΗΠΠΟΔΑΜΕΙΑ, Ίπποδάμεια. Between these two figures is a youthful head with curly hair and a Phrygian cap with lappets, looking downwards to right, above which is incised ΠΕΛΑΠ…, Πελάγ[ων]. On the right is Myrtilos moving away and looking back, beardless, with curly hair and bordered chlamys fastened with a fibula in front, in left hand a wreath, in right a wand; the lower part of his figure has been repainted; above him is incised ΜΥΡΤΙΛΟΣ, Μύρτίλος. On the extreme right is Aphrodite, seated to left, with hair tied in a bunch, open cap radiated in front, earrings, double necklace, bracelets, long chiton with looped-up sleeves and girdle, bordered himation, and sandals; in left hand she holds a string attached to a magic wheel lying on the ground. She holds up two fingers of right hand as if conversing with Eros, who hovers above to left, looking back at her; he has hair gathered in a knot, open cap radiated in front, earrings, double necklace, bracelets, anklet on left leg, in right hand an embroidered taenia, in left a phiale. Above these two figures is incised respectively: ΑΦΡΟΔΙΤΗ, 'Αφροδίτη, and ΕΡΩΣ, ‘Ερως. The ground-lines are indicated as usual. The scene apparently takes place before the palace of Oinomaos, represented by the pilos and sword hanging up, and by the two heads, which are probably those of former suitors slain by Oinomaos.\r\n(b) In the centre is a female figure to left, with left leg crossed over right, leaning on a white stele; she has hair in a bunch, open cap radiated in front, earrings, double necklace, bracelets, long girt chiton, himation, and sandals, in right hand a wreath, in left an embroidered taenia. Before her is a youth seated to right, with drapery under him and myrtle-wreath, in right hand a staff, in left a phiale containing fruit; between them is a taenia, and above, an iynx flying to right with an embroidered taenia in its claws. On the left is a female figure moving to right, with hair in a bunch, open beaded cap, earrings, double necklace, bracelets, long girt chiton, and shoes, in right hand a bunch of grapes, in left a large flower. She looks back at a youth to right, with left foot raised on a rock, myrtle-wreath, and drapery over left arm, holding out a wreath in both hands; above is a rosette. On the right is a youth to the front with myrtle-wreath, chlamys over arms, staff in left hand and mirror in right, looking back at a female figure to left, who holds out a white alabastron to him in right hand; she has hair tied in a bunch, open cap radiated in front, earrings, double necklace, bracelets, long girt chiton, and sandals, in left hand a wreath, over her right arm a white taenia; above are two rosettes. The ground-lines are indicated.\r\n2. On the lower row, a frieze representing offerings at a tomb: In the centre is an altar on a base with two bands of white dots; above it is an Ionic capital on which stands a fluted hydria; above hangs a white taenia with dots. On the right is a female figure approaching, about to place an embroidered taenia on the hydria; she wears bracelets; her figure is almost entirely repainted. Next is a youth seated to right, looking back, entirely repainted; behind him, a rosette and a flower; before him, a white taenia. Next, a similar youth to left, wearing a wreath, all but the top of his head repainted; behind him, a star of nine points. Next are two female figures, almost entirely repainted; the first to left with radiated cap and sandals, holding out an embroidered taenia in right hand; the other seated to the front, holding a fan in right hand and a box in left. Further to the right are four figures moving to left; first, Eros running, looking back, with embroidered taenia in right hand and phiale in left, mostly repainted. Next is a female figure with hair gathered in a radiated opisthosphendone, earrings, double necklace, long chiton, and himation in which left hand is muffled, in right band a large branch with fruit; before her is a laurel-branch. Next, a youth looking back, with myrtle-wreath and drapery over arms, in right hand a mirror; on his left hand is perched an iynx, and before him is a flower; his figure is slightly restored. Behind him is a female figure running, with bracelets, long chiton, sandals, and wreath in left hand, mostly repainted; before her, a rosette and a plant. Next to these is a female figure moving to right, with hair tied in a bunch, open cap radiated in front, earrings, necklace, bracelets, long girt chiton, himation over left arm held up in right hand, and sandals; on her left hand is a goose (?) to left. Before her is a female figure looking back, similarly attired, with himation round body and wreath in right hand from which hangs a white taenia, in left a pyxis and embroidered taenia. Lastly, a female figure seated to left looking back at the altar, with hair gathered in a radiated opisthosphendone, earrings, double necklace, bracelets, long chiton, himation, and sandals, in right hand an Apulian sistrum, in left a box with open lid, and an embroidered taenia. The ground-lines are indicated here and there, with occasional flowers.","Producer name":"Attributed to: The Varrese Painter","School\/style":null,"State":null,"Authority":null,"Ethnic name (made by)":null,"Ethnic name (assoc)":null,"Culture":"Apulian (Greek)","Production date":"360BC-330BC","Production place":"Made in: Puglia","Find spot":"Excavated\/Findspot: Ruvo (Puglia)","Materials":"pottery","Ware":"Red Figure","Type series":null,"Technique":"painted","Dimensions":"Height: 96 centimetres; Weight: 7 kilograms Approx ; Width: 36 centimetres","Inscription":null,"Curators Comments":"BM Cat.

Theseus, a beardless wreathed youth in a short undertied chiton, a mantle over his shoulders, petasos at back, sword hanging at side, and high endromides, stands en face, looking to left, holding two spears upright in his left hand. His right is grasped by Aegeus, an old man with white hair and beard, mantle and shoes, who leans forward on a staff, holding out in his left hand a rolled up band. Between these two figures Aithra stands to right, touching with finger-tips of both hands extended the chin of Theseus: she wears a long chiton untied, a mantle over her shoulders, earrings with triple pendants, and a radiated stephane. Behind Theseus on the right stands Pittheus, bearded, wreathed and draped in a mantle, and holding upright in his right his trident, of which the prongs are cut off by the border of the design: his long hair is looped up, and a single tress (parotis) falls beside the ear.\r\n(b) Nike offering phiale to a youth. The youth, who stands en face in the centre, is attired as Theseus in a, but has a chlamys fastened with a brooch on right shoulder, instead of chiton and mantle, and a fillet instead of a wreath; his long hair is fastened in a horizontal plait along his neck, with a single parotis: he holds two spears upright in his right; he looks to right at Nike, who also stands en face, but looks at him, holding upon her right palm, on a level with her eyes, a large phiale: with her left she lifts the skirt of her drapery: she wears a long sleeved chiton with apoptygma and cross-belts (stethodesma), earrings with triple pendant, and a curiously formed stephane: her hair hangs loose, and has the ends fastened in a club with a fillet. On the left stands a bearded man, holding in his left a staff, closely draped in an himation out of which his right hand projects, with fingers extended, beside his chest: his head is bald in a Λ-shaped patch over each temple, and he wears a fillet with a straight piece over the forehead.\r\nFine style, with traces of archaism. Purple fillets. White is used for the hair of Aegeus, and thinned brown laid on it for his fillet. Brown inner markings, cord of petasos, and hair on Theseus' cheek. Eye in profile. The locks at the edge of Theseus' hair are drawn in black outline filled in with brown. The design curves up over the shoulder, and is enclosed in a panel each side, as follows: below, key pattern: above, linked lotus: at sides, net. Round the lowest part of the body, a band of black rays on red. A thin purple line runs round the vase below the designs and around the neck.","Producer name":"Attributed to: The Oinanthe Painter","School\/style":null,"State":null,"Authority":null,"Ethnic name (made by)":null,"Ethnic name (assoc)":null,"Culture":"Attic","Production date":"480BC-460BC","Production place":"Made in: Attica (Greece)","Find spot":"Excavated\/Findspot: Vulci","Materials":"pottery","Ware":"Red Figure","Type series":null,"Technique":"painted","Dimensions":"Height: 50.80 centimetres","Inscription":null,"Curators Comments":"BM Cat.

Theseus, a beardless wreathed youth in a short undertied chiton, a mantle over his shoulders, petasos at back, sword hanging at side, and high endromides, stands en face, looking to left, holding two spears upright in his left hand. His right is grasped by Aegeus, an old man with white hair and beard, mantle and shoes, who leans forward on a staff, holding out in his left hand a rolled up band. Between these two figures Aithra stands to right, touching with finger-tips of both hands extended the chin of Theseus: she wears a long chiton untied, a mantle over her shoulders, earrings with triple pendants, and a radiated stephane. Behind Theseus on the right stands Pittheus, bearded, wreathed and draped in a mantle, and holding upright in his right his trident, of which the prongs are cut off by the border of the design: his long hair is looped up, and a single tress (parotis) falls beside the ear.\r\n(b) Nike offering phiale to a youth. The youth, who stands en face in the centre, is attired as Theseus in a, but has a chlamys fastened with a brooch on right shoulder, instead of chiton and mantle, and a fillet instead of a wreath; his long hair is fastened in a horizontal plait along his neck, with a single parotis: he holds two spears upright in his right; he looks to right at Nike, who also stands en face, but looks at him, holding upon her right palm, on a level with her eyes, a large phiale: with her left she lifts the skirt of her drapery: she wears a long sleeved chiton with apoptygma and cross-belts (stethodesma), earrings with triple pendant, and a curiously formed stephane: her hair hangs loose, and has the ends fastened in a club with a fillet. On the left stands a bearded man, holding in his left a staff, closely draped in an himation out of which his right hand projects, with fingers extended, beside his chest: his head is bald in a Λ-shaped patch over each temple, and he wears a fillet with a straight piece over the forehead.\r\nFine style, with traces of archaism. Purple fillets. White is used for the hair of Aegeus, and thinned brown laid on it for his fillet. Brown inner markings, cord of petasos, and hair on Theseus' cheek. Eye in profile. The locks at the edge of Theseus' hair are drawn in black outline filled in with brown. The design curves up over the shoulder, and is enclosed in a panel each side, as follows: below, key pattern: above, linked lotus: at sides, net. Round the lowest part of the body, a band of black rays on red. A thin purple line runs round the vase below the designs and around the neck.","Producer name":"Attributed to: The Oinanthe Painter","School\/style":null,"State":null,"Authority":null,"Ethnic name (made by)":null,"Ethnic name (assoc)":null,"Culture":"Attic","Production date":"480BC-460BC","Production place":"Made in: Attica (Greece)","Find spot":"Excavated\/Findspot: Vulci","Materials":"pottery","Ware":"Red Figure","Type series":null,"Technique":"painted","Dimensions":"Height: 50.80 centimetres","Inscription":null,"Curators Comments":"BM Cat.

Before him is Persephone to the front looking to right, with hair in a knot under an open cap and white radiated stephane, earrings, double necklace, bracelets, long girt chiton, himation, and white sandals; with right hand she draws forward her himation, in left she holds a wreath; her left arm rests on a torch with six arms, painted white. Between them hang a white petasos and a sword; behind Pluto is a white incense-burner; to the left of Persephone is a large mirror on the ground, the handle in the form of a nude figure, painted white, supporting the mirror with her arms. On the right is Hermes to left leaning against a laver painted white with egg-moulding round the top, on a fluted stem; he is beardless, with long curls, white petasos slung at back, chlamys fastened with a fibula in front, winged endromides, caduceus in left hand, two fingers of right hand extended to Pluto as if addressing him. Behind the laver is a large kylix; above Hermes, a prochoos and a white ball. On the left is Aphrodite, seated to left on a folding-stool with chevron-pattern along the top, looking back; her hair is tied in a bunch, with tresses over shoulders, and she wears an open beaded cap, earrings, double necklace, bracelets, long chiton, himation, and white sandals. In her right hand are an open box painted white and a white ball with patterns in yellow, hanging by a string, in left a parasol also painted white; she leans against a laver (as before). The ground-lines are indicated as usual.\r\n2. Toilet-scene: In the centre is a female figure seated to left on a white Ionic capital; her hair is tied in a bunch, and she wears open beaded cap, earrings, necklace, bracelets, long girt chiton with stripe down breast and side, and white sandals. In her right hand is a pyxis ornamented with across patee, containing flowers, in left hand a tympanon; behind her is an embroidered taenia. Before her is a youth seated to left, looking back, with beaded fillet, sandals, and drapery under him, in right hand a phiale with flowers, in left a bunch of grapes; below him, ground-lines. On the right is Eros seated on a rock to left, with hair in a bunch, open beaded cap, earrings, necklace, bracelets, strings of beads over right shoulder and round left thigh, anklet on left leg, and white sandals, in right hand a large flower; below him, a plant.\r\n(b) 1. In the centre is Eros seated to left on a rock, as in the last scene, in right hand a phiale containing three sprigs of myrtle, and a wreath. Before him a female figure advances, with hair tied in a bunch, striped open cap, earrings (?), necklace, bracelets, long girt chiton, and white sandals; in right hand a wreath from which hangs a white taenia, in left a pyxis ornamented with a cross patee, on which is fruit. Behind her is a taenia, and before her a laurel-shrub; below are ground-lines. Behind Eros is a female figure to left, as the other one, with long tresses falling over shoulders; she has a wreath in right hand from which hangs a white taenia, and her left hand rests on a white stele, holding a wreath. Before her is a laurel-shrub.\r\n2. Offerings at stele: In the centre is the stele, with white top and base; round it are tied a white and a black taenia. On either side is a female figure seated on raised ground, turned away from the stele but looking back; each has hair in a knot, open beaded cap, earrings, necklace, bracelets, long girt chiton fastened on shoulders, and white sandals. The one on the left has a mirror in right hand and a bunch of grapes in left; the other has a mirror in left hand, and in right a tympanon and a pyxis ornamented with a cross patee, containing flowers; below her is a rosette. The ground-lines are indicated.","Producer name":"Attributed to: The Patera Painter","School\/style":null,"State":null,"Authority":null,"Ethnic name (made by)":null,"Ethnic name (assoc)":null,"Culture":"Apulian (Greek)","Production date":"340BC-330BC (circa)","Production place":"Made in: Puglia","Find spot":"Excavated\/Findspot: Basilicata","Materials":"pottery","Ware":"Red Figure","Type series":null,"Technique":"painted","Dimensions":"Diameter: 40 centimetres; Height: 88.90 centimetres; Height: 89 centimetres; Weight: 4 kilograms","Inscription":null,"Curators Comments":"BM Cat.

On the neck, each side, palrnette and egg-moulding; below the designs, all round, maeander. On the shoulder, (a) above the design, rosettes and dots; below, egg-moulding; (b) wave-pattern and palmettes. The designs on the body are in two rows, divided by a band of (a) maeander in perspective, red and white, (b) rosettes and dots; the obverse designs are separated from those on the reverse by palmettes.\r\nOn the shoulder (a): Head of Hera (?) turned half to left, with curly hair, white stephane on which are yellow crenelle and chevron patterns, earrings, and double necklace, resting on a flower which branches out on either side in luxuriant blossoms and tendrils; on either side of the head, an alabastron (?).\r\n(a) 1. Scene in Hades: In the centre is Pluto seated to left on a seat painted white, with moulded legs, and maeander along the side; his feet rest on a footstool. He is bearded, with curly hair, long chiton with embroidered border round the top, girdle with white studs and vandyked borders, purple under-garment with long sleeves, himation, and endromides with rows of buttons; in right hand he holds out a phiale, in left is a tall sceptre with white dots, the top formed by a white Ionic capital, on which is perched a white eagle to left with open wings. Before him is Persephone to the front looking to right, with hair in a knot under an open cap and white radiated stephane, earrings, double necklace, bracelets, long girt chiton, himation, and white sandals; with right hand she draws forward her himation, in left she holds a wreath; her left arm rests on a torch with six arms, painted white. Between them hang a white petasos and a sword; behind Pluto is a white incense-burner; to the left of Persephone is a large mirror on the ground, the handle in the form of a nude figure, painted white, supporting the mirror with her arms. On the right is Hermes to left leaning against a laver painted white with egg-moulding round the top, on a fluted stem; he is beardless, with long curls, white petasos slung at back, chlamys fastened with a fibula in front, winged endromides, caduceus in left hand, two fingers of right hand extended to Pluto as if addressing him.

Toilet-scene: In the centre is a female figure seated to left on a white Ionic capital; her hair is tied in a bunch, and she wears open beaded cap, earrings, necklace, bracelets, long girt chiton with stripe down breast and side, and white sandals. In her right hand is a pyxis ornamented with across patee, containing flowers, in left hand a tympanon; behind her is an embroidered taenia. Before her is a youth seated to left, looking back, with beaded fillet, sandals, and drapery under him, in right hand a phiale with flowers, in left a bunch of grapes; below him, ground-lines.

Before him a female figure advances, with hair tied in a bunch, striped open cap, earrings (?), necklace, bracelets, long girt chiton, and white sandals; in right hand a wreath from which hangs a white taenia, in left a pyxis ornamented with a cross patee, on which is fruit. Behind her is a taenia, and before her a laurel-shrub; below are ground-lines. Behind Eros is a female figure to left, as the other one, with long tresses falling over shoulders; she has a wreath in right hand from which hangs a white taenia, and her left hand rests on a white stele, holding a wreath. Before her is a laurel-shrub.\r\n2. Offerings at stele: In the centre is the stele, with white top and base; round it are tied a white and a black taenia. On either side is a female figure seated on raised ground, turned away from the stele but looking back; each has hair in a knot, open beaded cap, earrings, necklace, bracelets, long girt chiton fastened on shoulders, and white sandals. The one on the left has a mirror in right hand and a bunch of grapes in left; the other has a mirror in left hand, and in right a tympanon and a pyxis ornamented with a cross patee, containing flowers; below her is a rosette.

Behind Orestes stands Apollo with two laurel-leaves in right hand, with which he sprinkles the blood over him; he is beardless, with hair in a knot, bordered chlamys and laurel-branch over left arm, in left hand a phiale. On the altar are two large acanthus-leaves; it bears an imitation inscription, apparently modern.\r\n(b) Two ephebi conversing, each with staff and himation over left shoulder; between them, a Doric column.","Producer name":"Attributed to: The Eumenides Painter","School\/style":null,"State":null,"Authority":null,"Ethnic name (made by)":null,"Ethnic name (assoc)":null,"Culture":"Apulian (Greek)","Production date":"380BC-360BC (circa)","Production place":"Made in: Puglia","Find spot":null,"Materials":"pottery","Ware":"Red Figure","Type series":null,"Technique":"painted","Dimensions":"Diameter: 34.29 centimetres; Height: 33 centimetres; Height: 33.02 centimetres; Weight: 2.60 kilograms; Width: 34.50 millimetres","Inscription":null,"Curators Comments":"BM Cat.

to the Nymphs. Hermes, beardless, with fillet, petasos knotted under his chin, chlamys, winged endromides, caduceus in his left hand, is seated on a rock to right, looking down at the infant Dionysos, whom he holds by the body in both his hands. Above them their names are inscribed, ΗΡΜΕΣ, 'Έρμης, ΔΙΩΝΥΣΣ, Διόνυσος. The infant, whose body faces Hermes, turns round to right and extends both its arms towards a Nymph, who stands with left hand on her hip, and leaning with the butt-end of her thyrsos on the rock; her right foot is drawn back and rests on the toes: her hair is looped up, and she wears a woollen fillet and an ivy-wreath; above her, her name, MAINAΣ, Μαîνας. On the left a second Nymph, Tethys (?), stands,  leaning forward with left foot on a high rectangular base, raising her left hand as if beckoning to the child; along her right arm she has a long staff terminating in two forked ivy-branches. Her head and left shoulder are wanting. Both the Nymphs wear an Ionic chiton and a mantle. Above Tethys, her name, …ΘΥΣ, Tή]θυς. The thyrsos of the other Nymph has an ivy-shoot springing upwards from near the butt.\r\n(b) Jumper and ephebi. Between two draped ephebi, each with a long staff or rod, a nude athlete, holding a jumping-weight (halter) in each hand, prepares to jump to left. The figure on left wears a fillet with straight piece over the forehead. This figure is much restored.\r\nLarge style. Purple inscriptions, ivy-leaves, cord of petasos, fillet in b. Brown inner markings, hair of Dionysos, and sandals of Hermes. Below, a continuous band of maeander; above, on a moulding a band of back-to-back palmettes, oblique; round the handles, egg pattern.","Producer name":"Attributed to: The Villa Giulia Painter","School\/style":null,"State":null,"Authority":null,"Ethnic name (made by)":null,"Ethnic name (assoc)":null,"Culture":"Attic","Production date":"470BC-450BC (circa)","Production place":"Made in: Attica (Greece)","Find spot":"Excavated\/Findspot: Nola","Materials":"pottery","Ware":"Red Figure","Type series":null,"Technique":"painted","Dimensions":"Diameter: 41.25 centimetres; Height: 41.91 centimetres","Inscription":"Inscription type: inscription","Curators Comments":"BM Cat.

red and white on black ground, with yellow accessories. Round the lip and ends of the handles, egg-moulding; above the designs, laurel-wreath; below, maeander and chequer; below the handles, palmettes.\r\n(a) Initiation of Heracles and the Dioscuri into the lesser mysteries at Agrae (or Eleusis): In the centre is Persephone standing half-turned to right, with long hair, beaded ampyx, earrings, necklace, bracelets, transparent white chiton with looped-up sleeves, himation held up in left hand, sandals, and torch in right hand; at her feet is Demeter seated to left, looking back at her. Demeter has long hair, beaded ampyx, earrings, necklace, bracelets, long chiton with diploidion, and sceptre in right hand; below her are a footstool and two uncertain objects of\r\noblong shape; the flesh of both figures is painted white, with ornaments and features in yellow. Persephone looks back at Triptolemos, who is seated to left looking up at her, in his winged carriage drawn by two white serpents; he is beardless, with long curls, laurel-wreath, and himation over left shoulder. Above him is Eumolpos, acting as μυσταγωγός; he moves to left, looking back, and is beardless, with long curls, fillet and laurel-wreath, girt chiton reaching to the knee with embroidered band on bosom, endromides, and torch in right hand; he leads up one of the Dioscuri, who is beardless, with wreath, chlamys over shoulders, and a large torch painted white in right hand; in front of his head is a star of nine points. On the left Iachos approaches, beardless, with fillet and laurel-wreath, chiton as Eumolpos, beaded girdle, chlamys over right arm, endromides, torch in right hand, left extended; he is followed by Heracles, and, on a higher level, the other of the Dioscuri. Heracles looks back, and is beardless, with short curly hair, wreath, chlamys over shoulders, torch in right hand and club in left; the Dioscuros is beardless, with wreath, himation over left shoulder, and torch in  right  hand. Behind, over an uneven line indicating a hill, appear six Doric columns, over four of which is a white architrave, possibly representing the temple of Demeter at Agrae.\r\n(b) Dionysiac group: In the centre is a couch covered with a panther's skin, on which recline the youthful Dionysos and Pluto, each resting left arm on an embroidered pillow. Dionysos has long curls, fillet with cross-band round the back of the head, ivy-wreath, drapery over lower limbs, and thyrsos in right hand; he turns to look at Pluto, who looks back at him; he has short curly hair with laurel-wreath, drapery over lower limbs, and in both hands a large rhyton, painted white, with egg-moulding round the top and a row of fruits above. On the left stands a Maenad to right, above the ground-level, with flesh painted white, hair drawn back  and tied round with a string, ivy-wreath, radiated ampyx, earrings, necklace, bracelets, long chiton and bordered himation falling in pteryges, hands extended, in left a dish of fruit. On a lower level is a Satyr to right with ivy-wreath and fawn-skin over left arm, carrying a dish of fruit from which hang white strings, and behind him above is a female figure seated to left, looking round to right, with radiated ampyx, hair tied in a knot behind, bracelets, and long girt chiton drawn forward in left hand, in right a dish of fruit. On the right a Satyr with ivy-wreath, and torch in right hand, leads up Hephaestos in a drunken condition; he is bearded, with fillet, ivy-wreath, chlamys over arms, axe in left hand, right arm resting on the Satyr's shoulder. Below the couch is Eros to right, nude, with beaded fillet and flesh painted white, holding a spring, the end of which is held in the beak of a swan with which he is playing; behind him is an ivy-branch; in the field, flowers, and above the scene, a vine with grapes.","Producer name":"Attributed to: The Pourtalès Painter","School\/style":null,"State":null,"Authority":null,"Ethnic name (made by)":null,"Ethnic name (assoc)":null,"Culture":"Attic","Production date":"380BC-360BC (circa)","Production place":"Made in: Attica (Greece)","Find spot":"Excavated\/Findspot: St Agata dei Goti","Materials":"pottery","Ware":"Red Figure","Type series":null,"Technique":"painted","Dimensions":"Diameter: 50.70 centimetres; Height: 51.40 centimetres; Weight: 6 kilograms","Inscription":null,"Curators Comments":"BM Cat.

The torches carried by the Dioscuri and Heracles are of a peculiar shape, resembling fasces, with projecting knobs; they are probably made of palm-branches bound together, and were known as Βάκχοι.

Above him is Eumolpos, acting as μυσταγωγός; he moves to left, looking back, and is beardless, with long curls, fillet and laurel-wreath, girt chiton reaching to the knee with embroidered band on bosom, endromides, and torch in right hand; he leads up one of the Dioscuri, who is beardless, with wreath, chlamys over shoulders, and a large torch painted white in right hand; in front of his head is a star of nine points. On the left Iachos approaches, beardless, with fillet and laurel-wreath, chiton as Eumolpos, beaded girdle, chlamys over right arm, endromides, torch in right hand, left extended; he is followed by Heracles, and, on a higher level, the other of the Dioscuri. Heracles looks back, and is beardless, with short curly hair, wreath, chlamys over shoulders, torch in right hand and club in left; the Dioscuros is beardless, with wreath, himation over left shoulder, and torch in  right  hand. Behind, over an uneven line indicating a hill, appear six Doric columns, over four of which is a white architrave, possibly representing the temple of Demeter at Agrae.\r\n(b) Dionysiac group: In the centre is a couch covered with a panther's skin, on which recline the youthful Dionysos and Pluto, each resting left arm on an embroidered pillow. Dionysos has long curls, fillet with cross-band round the back of the head, ivy-wreath, drapery over lower limbs, and thyrsos in right hand; he turns to look at Pluto, who looks back at him; he has short curly hair with laurel-wreath, drapery over lower limbs, and in both hands a large rhyton, painted white, with egg-moulding round the top and a row of fruits above. On the left stands a Maenad to right, above the ground-level, with flesh painted white, hair drawn back  and tied round with a string, ivy-wreath, radiated ampyx, earrings, necklace, bracelets, long chiton and bordered himation falling in pteryges, hands extended, in left a dish of fruit. On a lower level is a Satyr to right with ivy-wreath and fawn-skin over left arm, carrying a dish of fruit from which hang white strings, and behind him above is a female figure seated to left, looking round to right, with radiated ampyx, hair tied in a knot behind, bracelets, and long girt chiton drawn forward in left hand, in right a dish of fruit. On the right a Satyr with ivy-wreath, and torch in right hand, leads up Hephaestos in a drunken condition; he is bearded, with fillet, ivy-wreath, chlamys over arms, axe in left hand, right arm resting on the Satyr's shoulder. Below the couch is Eros to right, nude, with beaded fillet and flesh painted white, holding a spring, the end of which is held in the beak of a swan with which he is playing; behind him is an ivy-branch; in the field, flowers, and above the scene, a vine with grapes.","Producer name":"Attributed to: The Pourtalès Painter","School\/style":null,"State":null,"Authority":null,"Ethnic name (made by)":null,"Ethnic name (assoc)":null,"Culture":"Attic","Production date":"380BC-360BC (circa)","Production place":"Made in: Attica (Greece)","Find spot":"Excavated\/Findspot: St Agata dei Goti","Materials":"pottery","Ware":"Red Figure","Type series":null,"Technique":"painted","Dimensions":"Diameter: 50.70 centimetres; Height: 51.40 centimetres; Weight: 6 kilograms","Inscription":null,"Curators Comments":"BM Cat.

The torches carried by the Dioscuri and Heracles are of a peculiar shape, resembling fasces, with projecting knobs; they are probably made of palm-branches bound together, and were known as Βάκχοι.

Behind, over an uneven line indicating a hill, appear six Doric columns, over four of which is a white architrave, possibly representing the temple of Demeter at Agrae.\r\n(b) Dionysiac group: In the centre is a couch covered with a panther's skin, on which recline the youthful Dionysos and Pluto, each resting left arm on an embroidered pillow. Dionysos has long curls, fillet with cross-band round the back of the head, ivy-wreath, drapery over lower limbs, and thyrsos in right hand; he turns to look at Pluto, who looks back at him; he has short curly hair with laurel-wreath, drapery over lower limbs, and in both hands a large rhyton, painted white, with egg-moulding round the top and a row of fruits above. On the left stands a Maenad to right, above the ground-level, with flesh painted white, hair drawn back  and tied round with a string, ivy-wreath, radiated ampyx, earrings, necklace, bracelets, long chiton and bordered himation falling in pteryges, hands extended, in left a dish of fruit. On a lower level is a Satyr to right with ivy-wreath and fawn-skin over left arm, carrying a dish of fruit from which hang white strings, and behind him above is a female figure seated to left, looking round to right, with radiated ampyx, hair tied in a knot behind, bracelets, and long girt chiton drawn forward in left hand, in right a dish of fruit. On the right a Satyr with ivy-wreath, and torch in right hand, leads up Hephaestos in a drunken condition; he is bearded, with fillet, ivy-wreath, chlamys over arms, axe in left hand, right arm resting on the Satyr's shoulder. Below the couch is Eros to right, nude, with beaded fillet and flesh painted white, holding a spring, the end of which is held in the beak of a swan with which he is playing; behind him is an ivy-branch; in the field, flowers, and above the scene, a vine with grapes.","Producer name":"Attributed to: The Pourtalès Painter","School\/style":null,"State":null,"Authority":null,"Ethnic name (made by)":null,"Ethnic name (assoc)":null,"Culture":"Attic","Production date":"380BC-360BC (circa)","Production place":"Made in: Attica (Greece)","Find spot":"Excavated\/Findspot: St Agata dei Goti","Materials":"pottery","Ware":"Red Figure","Type series":null,"Technique":"painted","Dimensions":"Diameter: 50.70 centimetres; Height: 51.40 centimetres; Weight: 6 kilograms","Inscription":null,"Curators Comments":"BM Cat.

The torches carried by the Dioscuri and Heracles are of a peculiar shape, resembling fasces, with projecting knobs; they are probably made of palm-branches bound together, and were known as Βάκχοι.

On the right is a Satyr to right, dancing, with left hand raised and a torch in right; below his feet is a rhyton. On the left are a Satyr and Maenad to left dancing; the Satyr is ithyphallic, and looks back at the Maenad, extending left hand to her; she has a chiton as the first, right hand placed on breast, left raised holding crotala. In the background between them is the upper part of an Ionic column painted white; between the Satyr's feet are rocks.\r\n(b) Three ephebi conversing, wrapped in himatia, the centre one to right; the one on the left holds a ball on which is a pattern of a cross and dots, the one on the right a staff.","Producer name":"Attributed to: The Retorted Painter","School\/style":null,"State":null,"Authority":null,"Ethnic name (made by)":null,"Ethnic name (assoc)":null,"Culture":"Attic","Production date":"380BC-360BC","Production place":"Made in: Attica (Greece)","Find spot":null,"Materials":"pottery","Ware":"Red Figure","Type series":null,"Technique":"painted","Dimensions":"Diameter: 34.29 centimetres; Height: 33.02 centimetres","Inscription":null,"Curators Comments":"BM Cat.

\r\nDesigns red on black ground, with white accessories. Above the designs, laurel-wreath; below, maeander and  chequer; round the ends of the handles, egg-moulding; below the handles, palmettes.\r\n(a) Scene from a comedy; parody of the myth of Cheiron cured by Apollo (or Asclepios): On the left is a stage, on which is a side-view of a doorway with projecting porch ornamented with an egg-moulding and scroll-pattern; this represents the temple of Apollo at Delphi.  The porch is supported by a sloping bracket; below the stage are two festoons. The stage is approached by a ladder of four steps, on the second of which stands the slave Xanthias, who has preceded Cheiron up the ladder, and turns round to help him up by placing right hand on his head. Xanthias is bald and bearded, with short girt bordered chiton, under-garment with sleeves and anaxyrides in one piece, and phallos; he wears a mask with snub nose and large mouth. On the stage behind him are a large bundle ornamented with zigzags and rings, fastened to a yoke, and a pilos, which he has laid down to assist Cheiron; above him is incised: ...VθΙΑΣ, Ξα]νθίας. Cheiron stands on the two lower steps, leaning on a crooked staff; the hinder part of the Centaur is formed by a slave pushing from behind. Cheiron is partly bald, with white hair, beard, and shaggy eyebrows, mask with exaggerated nose and mouth, bordered himation, under-garment as Xanthias, and phallos; his eyes are closed to indicate blindness. The slave is partly bald, with white hair and beard, mask and dress as Cheiron; behind him is a youth to left, wearing wreath and himation, probably Achilles, who was the Centaur’s pupil. Above Cheiron is incised: ΧΙΡΩΝ, Χίρων. On the right above is a line indicating rocky ground, over which are seen the upper parts of two Nymphs partly turned towards one another, as if conversing; they have masks with protruding lips, and wear white fillets, long chitons, and bordered himatia. The one on the right wears a veil, which she draws forward with right hand, and the other has curly hair and a beaded ampyx; above them is incised: NY…ΑΙ, Νύ[μφ]αί. The presence of these two figures may have reference to the Nymphs of Anigros, where Cheiron bathed after being wounded by Heracles.\r\n(b) In the centre is an athlete seated on a rock to left, nude and beardless, holding up an aryballos by a thong in right hand. On either side facing him is a youth in a himation, the one on the right with staff and right shoulder left bare; above hangs a pair of halteres.","Producer name":"Attributed to: The McDaniel Painter","School\/style":null,"State":null,"Authority":null,"Ethnic name (made by)":null,"Ethnic name (assoc)":null,"Culture":"Apulian (Greek)","Production date":"380BC-370BC (circa)","Production place":"Made in: Puglia","Find spot":null,"Materials":"pottery","Ware":"Red Figure","Type series":null,"Technique":"painted","Dimensions":"Diameter: 40 centimetres checked ; Height: 38 centimetres checked","Inscription":null,"Curators Comments":"BM Cat.

type":"bell krater","Museum number":"No: 1849,0620.13","Title":null,"Denomination":null,"Escapement":null,"Description":"Pottery: red-figured bell-krater showing a scene from South Italian comedy. \r\nDesigns red on black ground, with white accessories. Above the designs, laurel-wreath; below, maeander and  chequer; round the ends of the handles, egg-moulding; below the handles, palmettes.\r\n(a) Scene from a comedy; parody of the myth of Cheiron cured by Apollo (or Asclepios): On the left is a stage, on which is a side-view of a doorway with projecting porch ornamented with an egg-moulding and scroll-pattern; this represents the temple of Apollo at Delphi.  The porch is supported by a sloping bracket; below the stage are two festoons. The stage is approached by a ladder of four steps, on the second of which stands the slave Xanthias, who has preceded Cheiron up the ladder, and turns round to help him up by placing right hand on his head. Xanthias is bald and bearded, with short girt bordered chiton, under-garment with sleeves and anaxyrides in one piece, and phallos; he wears a mask with snub nose and large mouth. On the stage behind him are a large bundle ornamented with zigzags and rings, fastened to a yoke, and a pilos, which he has laid down to assist Cheiron; above him is incised: ...VθΙΑΣ, Ξα]νθίας. Cheiron stands on the two lower steps, leaning on a crooked staff; the hinder part of the Centaur is formed by a slave pushing from behind. Cheiron is partly bald, with white hair, beard, and shaggy eyebrows, mask with exaggerated nose and mouth, bordered himation, under-garment as Xanthias, and phallos; his eyes are closed to indicate blindness. The slave is partly bald, with white hair and beard, mask and dress as Cheiron; behind him is a youth to left, wearing wreath and himation, probably Achilles, who was the Centaur’s pupil. Above Cheiron is incised: ΧΙΡΩΝ, Χίρων. On the right above is a line indicating rocky ground, over which are seen the upper parts of two Nymphs partly turned towards one another, as if conversing; they have masks with protruding lips, and wear white fillets, long chitons, and bordered himatia. The one on the right wears a veil, which she draws forward with right hand, and the other has curly hair and a beaded ampyx; above them is incised: NY…ΑΙ, Νύ[μφ]αί. The presence of these two figures may have reference to the Nymphs of Anigros, where Cheiron bathed after being wounded by Heracles.\r\n(b) In the centre is an athlete seated on a rock to left, nude and beardless, holding up an aryballos by a thong in right hand. On either side facing him is a youth in a himation, the one on the right with staff and right shoulder left bare; above hangs a pair of halteres.","Producer name":"Attributed to: The McDaniel Painter","School\/style":null,"State":null,"Authority":null,"Ethnic name (made by)":null,"Ethnic name (assoc)":null,"Culture":"Apulian (Greek)","Production date":"380BC-370BC (circa)","Production place":"Made in: Puglia","Find spot":null,"Materials":"pottery","Ware":"Red Figure","Type series":null,"Technique":"painted","Dimensions":"Diameter: 40 centimetres checked ; Height: 38 centimetres checked","Inscription":null,"Curators Comments":"BM Cat.

Before him a Maenad rushes to right looking back, with hair in a knot at back, earrings, necklace, bracelets, long chiton and embroidered diploidion, sandals, flesh painted white, right hand raised, torch in left. Beyond her on a higher level is an ithyphallic Satyr to right, dancing and looking back, with right hand extended; below him, a plinth. On the left is an ithyphallic Satyr to right, with hands raised as if addressing a Maenad who rushes to right, looking to left; she is attired as the other (no bracelets, on left arm a panther's skin), and carries a thyrsos, with the butt end of which she strikes at the Satyr. Below her is a Satyr on a smaller scale advancing to right and playing the double flute; behind him, a rhyton.\r\n(b) Nike standing to right between two ephebi; she has her hair gathered in a knot, long girt chiton leaving right shoulder bare, and hands extended to clasp right hand of the one facing her. The ephebi have himatia over their left shoulders; the one on the left has his right arm behind his head.","Producer name":"Attributed to: The Telos Painter","School\/style":null,"State":null,"Authority":null,"Ethnic name (made by)":null,"Ethnic name (assoc)":null,"Culture":"Attic","Production date":"390BC-360BC","Production place":"Made in: Attica (Greece)","Find spot":null,"Materials":"pottery","Ware":"Red Figure","Type series":null,"Technique":"painted","Dimensions":"Diameter: 39.37 centimetres; Height: 38.70 centimetres","Inscription":null,"Curators Comments":"BM Cat.

On the right a bearded man in an himation, also wreathed, looks on, resting his right on a staff. In the field imitation inscriptions.\r\n(b) Two draped ephebi, staff in hand, confronted; between them a third, to left    Each wears a fillet.\r\nOn the foot an incised inscription. \r\nLate careless drawing. Purple inscriptions, stems of wreaths, and flames. Brown ties on altar. Below, sets of three maeanders separated by dotted chequer squares. Round the lip, laurel-wreath. Round the handles, egg pattern; below the handles, an ornament composed of two palmettes superimposed.","Producer name":"Attributed to: The Pothos Painter","School\/style":null,"State":null,"Authority":null,"Ethnic name (made by)":null,"Ethnic name (assoc)":null,"Culture":"Attic","Production date":"430BC-410BC (circa)","Production place":"Made in: Attica (Greece)","Find spot":null,"Materials":"pottery","Ware":"Red Figure","Type series":null,"Technique":"painted","Dimensions":"Height: 30.90 centimetres","Inscription":"Inscription type: inscription","Curators Comments":"BM Cat.

On the right a bearded man in an himation, also wreathed, looks on, resting his right on a staff. In the field imitation inscriptions.\r\n(b) Two draped ephebi, staff in hand, confronted; between them a third, to left    Each wears a fillet.\r\nOn the foot an incised inscription. \r\nLate careless drawing. Purple inscriptions, stems of wreaths, and flames. Brown ties on altar. Below, sets of three maeanders separated by dotted chequer squares. Round the lip, laurel-wreath. Round the handles, egg pattern; below the handles, an ornament composed of two palmettes superimposed.","Producer name":"Attributed to: The Pothos Painter","School\/style":null,"State":null,"Authority":null,"Ethnic name (made by)":null,"Ethnic name (assoc)":null,"Culture":"Attic","Production date":"430BC-410BC (circa)","Production place":"Made in: Attica (Greece)","Find spot":null,"Materials":"pottery","Ware":"Red Figure","Type series":null,"Technique":"painted","Dimensions":"Height: 30.90 centimetres","Inscription":"Inscription type: inscription","Curators Comments":"BM Cat.

On the right a bearded man in an himation, also wreathed, looks on, resting his right on a staff. In the field imitation inscriptions.\r\n(b) Two draped ephebi, staff in hand, confronted; between them a third, to left    Each wears a fillet.\r\nOn the foot an incised inscription. \r\nLate careless drawing. Purple inscriptions, stems of wreaths, and flames. Brown ties on altar. Below, sets of three maeanders separated by dotted chequer squares. Round the lip, laurel-wreath. Round the handles, egg pattern; below the handles, an ornament composed of two palmettes superimposed.","Producer name":"Attributed to: The Pothos Painter","School\/style":null,"State":null,"Authority":null,"Ethnic name (made by)":null,"Ethnic name (assoc)":null,"Culture":"Attic","Production date":"430BC-410BC (circa)","Production place":"Made in: Attica (Greece)","Find spot":null,"Materials":"pottery","Ware":"Red Figure","Type series":null,"Technique":"painted","Dimensions":"Height: 30.90 centimetres","Inscription":"Inscription type: inscription","Curators Comments":"BM Cat.

A more youthful figure, with radiated fillet, the ends of which hang down, climbs on to the chair, on which his left foot is placed, with the aid of a staff in his left hand. On the right is a Doric column, beyond which a bearded middle-aged man stands looking on, with a white fillet, the ends of which hang down, himation over left shoulder, and right hand on knee; behind him is a doorway, with a half-door over which a youth in a himation is leaning, looking to left. Within is seen the upper part of the door in perspective, turned back on its hinge; on both parts are broad black bands studded with large white nails.\r\n(b) Three ephebi conversing, wearing fillets and wrapped in himatia; the central figure stands to right, and the one on the right extends right hand as if speaking.

A more youthful figure, with radiated fillet, the ends of which hang down, climbs on to the chair, on which his left foot is placed, with the aid of a staff in his left hand. On the right is a Doric column, beyond which a bearded middle-aged man stands looking on, with a white fillet, the ends of which hang down, himation over left shoulder, and right hand on knee; behind him is a doorway, with a half-door over which a youth in a himation is leaning, looking to left. Within is seen the upper part of the door in perspective, turned back on its hinge; on both parts are broad black bands studded with large white nails.\r\n(b) Three ephebi conversing, wearing fillets and wrapped in himatia; the central figure stands to right, and the one on the right extends right hand as if speaking.

omphalos. In the centre is the omphalos, of the usual form, with four fillets of white wool hanging over it. On the left Apollo stands to right, playing on the kithara with his left hand, and with his right pouring on the omphalos wine from a fluted phiale; he is wreathed with laurel, and has long hair looped up behind, and a long chiton schistos with apoptygma, over a thin Ionic chiton. Behind him Hermes advances, with chlamys, petasos and caduceus, holding up in his right a sprig of myrtle (?). On the right of the omphalos Artemis stands in three-quarter face to left, but looking at Apollo, holding in her right a trefoil oinochoe, in her left her bow; she has her hair looped up with a fillet, a quiver at her back, a long chiton with apoptygma and earrings. On the right Leto advances, in Ionic chiton, a mantle which covers the back of her head, and a radiate stephane, holding up in her right a phiale. The kithara of Apollo has a long sash attached to it, decorated with alternate rows of circles and zigzags.\r\n(b) Three draped ephebi: the central one stands en face, and looks at the one on right, who holds a staff; each wears a fillet.\r\nLate stage of good period. Purple wine, bow-string, fillets on omphalos, stem of wreath, fillets and sprig in Hermes' hand. Below, sets of three maeanders separated by red cross squares; round lip, laurel-wreath; round handles, egg pattern; below handles, a palmette on another.","Producer name":"Attributed to the Manner of: The Dinos Painter","School\/style":null,"State":null,"Authority":null,"Ethnic name (made by)":null,"Ethnic name (assoc)":null,"Culture":"Attic","Production date":"425BC-410BC (circa)","Production place":"Made in: Attica (Greece)","Find spot":"Excavated\/Findspot: Nola","Materials":"pottery","Ware":"Red Figure","Type series":null,"Technique":"painted","Dimensions":"Diameter: 33.02 centimetres; Height: 33.02 centimetres","Inscription":null,"Curators Comments":"BM Cat.

omphalos. In the centre is the omphalos, of the usual form, with four fillets of white wool hanging over it. On the left Apollo stands to right, playing on the kithara with his left hand, and with his right pouring on the omphalos wine from a fluted phiale; he is wreathed with laurel, and has long hair looped up behind, and a long chiton schistos with apoptygma, over a thin Ionic chiton. Behind him Hermes advances, with chlamys, petasos and caduceus, holding up in his right a sprig of myrtle (?). On the right of the omphalos Artemis stands in three-quarter face to left, but looking at Apollo, holding in her right a trefoil oinochoe, in her left her bow; she has her hair looped up with a fillet, a quiver at her back, a long chiton with apoptygma and earrings. On the right Leto advances, in Ionic chiton, a mantle which covers the back of her head, and a radiate stephane, holding up in her right a phiale. The kithara of Apollo has a long sash attached to it, decorated with alternate rows of circles and zigzags.\r\n(b) Three draped ephebi: the central one stands en face, and looks at the one on right, who holds a staff; each wears a fillet.\r\nLate stage of good period. Purple wine, bow-string, fillets on omphalos, stem of wreath, fillets and sprig in Hermes' hand. Below, sets of three maeanders separated by red cross squares; round lip, laurel-wreath; round handles, egg pattern; below handles, a palmette on another.","Producer name":"Attributed to the Manner of: The Dinos Painter","School\/style":null,"State":null,"Authority":null,"Ethnic name (made by)":null,"Ethnic name (assoc)":null,"Culture":"Attic","Production date":"425BC-410BC (circa)","Production place":"Made in: Attica (Greece)","Find spot":"Excavated\/Findspot: Nola","Materials":"pottery","Ware":"Red Figure","Type series":null,"Technique":"painted","Dimensions":"Diameter: 33.02 centimetres; Height: 33.02 centimetres","Inscription":null,"Curators Comments":"BM Cat.

Above the designs, (a) ivy-wreath and egg-moulding, (b) laurel-wreath; under the handles, palmette-patterns; below the designs, (a) maeander and chequer, (b) wave-pattern.\r\n(a) Alcmene appealing to Zeus against Amphitryon: In the centre is Alcmene, seated to left on an altar, which is painted white with egg-moulding along the top and an imitation of triglyphs below (markings in yellow); in front of it is erected a pyre of round logs. She has long curls, necklace and bracelets, an embroidered veil over her head, long chiton and apoptygma embroidered with chequer, palmettes, and other patterns, girdle with white studs, and sandals; her right hand is raised in supplication. Above the design is incised: ΑΛΚΜΗΝΗ, 'Αλκμήνη. On the right is Amphitryon to left setting fire to the pyre with a torch in each hand; he is bearded, with long hair, short embroidered chiton with engrailed and palmette patterns and border of white dots, embroidered chlamys with border of chequer over his arms, endromides, and purple cross-belt from which hangs a sheathed sword; above him is incised: ΑΜΦΙΤΡΥΩΝ, Άμφιτρύων. On the left is Antenor starting back to left, looking to right, beardless, with long curls, white pilos, short sleeved embroidered chiton with borders of engrailed and wave patterns, girdle and cross-belt with astragalus pattern, embroidered chlamys with border of dots, fastened with a fibula in front, and endromides; between his legs is a fallen yellow prochoos; above him is incised: ΑΝΤΗΝΩΡ, Άντήνωρ. Over the altar is a purple and white rainbow enclosing a black space which is filled with white dots, representing drops of the rain sent in answer to Alcmene's prayer; below the pyre are two white thunderbolts, as if cast by Zeus at Amphitryon and Antenor. On each side of the rainbow, on a higher level (indicated by a wavy white line ending in a palmette), is the upper half of a female figure pouring water out of a hydria, which is indicated by black and white streaks; these two figures are the Hyades. The one on the left has long hair, a broad purple fillet with white chevron pattern, necklace, long purple chiton embroidered with white dots, and white girdle; the other has her hair tied in a club with a purple  fillet embroidered with white dots, which goes twice round her head; otherwise she is attired as the first. On the left, on the same level, is the upper part of Zeus to right, bearded, with long curls, wreath, and drapery over left shoulder with chequer border, in right hand a sceptre, left extended; he is inscribed ΙΕΥΣ, Ζέυς. On the right is Eos to left, with  hair gathered in a knot at the back under a purple cap embroidered with white dots, earrings, necklace, long chiton and apoptygma, embroidered with palmettes and engrailed border; in right hand she holds up a mirror; above her is inscribed ΑΩΣ, (Ή)ώς. Under the lip of the vase is incised: ΠΥΘΩΝΕΓΡΑΦΕ, Πυθων έγραφε. \r\n(b) Dionysiac scene: In the centre is Dionysos, moving to right and looking to left, beardless, with long curls, round which is a taenia tied at the back, shoulder-belt with white dots, chlamys with border of dots over left arm, shoes, thyrsos in left hand, to which is tied a purple taenia; in right hand a wreath from which hangs a purple taenia. On either side is a Maenad dancing to right, the one on the right looking back. The one on the left has long curls, wreath, necklace, bracelets, long girt chiton and apoptygma reaching to the hips with borders of wave-pattern and dots, fastened with fibulae on the shoulders, shoes, thyrsos in right hand to which a purple taenia is tied, left hand raised. The one on the right has long curls, one of which hangs down in front of her face, wreath, necklace, bracelets, long transparent chiton embroidered with dots, which has slipped off her right shoulder, thyrsos in left hand with purple taenia tied to it, wreath in right at which she is looking. On a higher level are seen the upper parts of three figures: a youthful Satyr on the left, a youthful male figure in the centre, and Pan on the right. The Satyr wears wreath and shoulder-belt of white beads, and holds out a tympanon in left hand to the youth who faces him; he has a wreath, shoulder-belt as the  Satyr, and  thyrsos in left hand. Pan is to left, with small beard and moustache, wreath and shoulder-belt as the others; his body is stippled all over, and part of the goat-skin is visible; his hands are raised as if in astonishment.","Producer name":"Attributed to: Python (painter)","School\/style":null,"State":null,"Authority":null,"Ethnic name (made by)":null,"Ethnic name (assoc)":null,"Culture":"Paestan","Production date":"360BC-320BC","Production place":"Made in: Paestum","Find spot":"Excavated\/Findspot: St Agata dei Goti","Materials":"pottery","Ware":"Red Figure","Type series":null,"Technique":"painted","Dimensions":"Diameter: 51.50 centimetres; Height: 56.50 centimetres; Weight: 12.50 kilograms","Inscription":null,"Curators Comments":"BM Cat.

Above the designs, (a) ivy-wreath and egg-moulding, (b) laurel-wreath; under the handles, palmette-patterns; below the designs, (a) maeander and chequer, (b) wave-pattern.\r\n(a) Alcmene appealing to Zeus against Amphitryon: In the centre is Alcmene, seated to left on an altar, which is painted white with egg-moulding along the top and an imitation of triglyphs below (markings in yellow); in front of it is erected a pyre of round logs. She has long curls, necklace and bracelets, an embroidered veil over her head, long chiton and apoptygma embroidered with chequer, palmettes, and other patterns, girdle with white studs, and sandals; her right hand is raised in supplication. Above the design is incised: ΑΛΚΜΗΝΗ, 'Αλκμήνη. On the right is Amphitryon to left setting fire to the pyre with a torch in each hand; he is bearded, with long hair, short embroidered chiton with engrailed and palmette patterns and border of white dots, embroidered chlamys with border of chequer over his arms, endromides, and purple cross-belt from which hangs a sheathed sword; above him is incised: ΑΜΦΙΤΡΥΩΝ, Άμφιτρύων. On the left is Antenor starting back to left, looking to right, beardless, with long curls, white pilos, short sleeved embroidered chiton with borders of engrailed and wave patterns, girdle and cross-belt with astragalus pattern, embroidered chlamys with border of dots, fastened with a fibula in front, and endromides; between his legs is a fallen yellow prochoos; above him is incised: ΑΝΤΗΝΩΡ, Άντήνωρ. Over the altar is a purple and white rainbow enclosing a black space which is filled with white dots, representing drops of the rain sent in answer to Alcmene's prayer; below the pyre are two white thunderbolts, as if cast by Zeus at Amphitryon and Antenor. On each side of the rainbow, on a higher level (indicated by a wavy white line ending in a palmette), is the upper half of a female figure pouring water out of a hydria, which is indicated by black and white streaks; these two figures are the Hyades. The one on the left has long hair, a broad purple fillet with white chevron pattern, necklace, long purple chiton embroidered with white dots, and white girdle; the other has her hair tied in a club with a purple  fillet embroidered with white dots, which goes twice round her head; otherwise she is attired as the first. On the left, on the same level, is the upper part of Zeus to right, bearded, with long curls, wreath, and drapery over left shoulder with chequer border, in right hand a sceptre, left extended; he is inscribed ΙΕΥΣ, Ζέυς. On the right is Eos to left, with  hair gathered in a knot at the back under a purple cap embroidered with white dots, earrings, necklace, long chiton and apoptygma, embroidered with palmettes and engrailed border; in right hand she holds up a mirror; above her is inscribed ΑΩΣ, (Ή)ώς. Under the lip of the vase is incised: ΠΥΘΩΝΕΓΡΑΦΕ, Πυθων έγραφε. \r\n(b) Dionysiac scene: In the centre is Dionysos, moving to right and looking to left, beardless, with long curls, round which is a taenia tied at the back, shoulder-belt with white dots, chlamys with border of dots over left arm, shoes, thyrsos in left hand, to which is tied a purple taenia; in right hand a wreath from which hangs a purple taenia. On either side is a Maenad dancing to right, the one on the right looking back. The one on the left has long curls, wreath, necklace, bracelets, long girt chiton and apoptygma reaching to the hips with borders of wave-pattern and dots, fastened with fibulae on the shoulders, shoes, thyrsos in right hand to which a purple taenia is tied, left hand raised. The one on the right has long curls, one of which hangs down in front of her face, wreath, necklace, bracelets, long transparent chiton embroidered with dots, which has slipped off her right shoulder, thyrsos in left hand with purple taenia tied to it, wreath in right at which she is looking. On a higher level are seen the upper parts of three figures: a youthful Satyr on the left, a youthful male figure in the centre, and Pan on the right. The Satyr wears wreath and shoulder-belt of white beads, and holds out a tympanon in left hand to the youth who faces him; he has a wreath, shoulder-belt as the  Satyr, and  thyrsos in left hand. Pan is to left, with small beard and moustache, wreath and shoulder-belt as the others; his body is stippled all over, and part of the goat-skin is visible; his hands are raised as if in astonishment.","Producer name":"Attributed to: Python (painter)","School\/style":null,"State":null,"Authority":null,"Ethnic name (made by)":null,"Ethnic name (assoc)":null,"Culture":"Paestan","Production date":"360BC-320BC","Production place":"Made in: Paestum","Find spot":"Excavated\/Findspot: St Agata dei Goti","Materials":"pottery","Ware":"Red Figure","Type series":null,"Technique":"painted","Dimensions":"Diameter: 51.50 centimetres; Height: 56.50 centimetres; Weight: 12.50 kilograms","Inscription":null,"Curators Comments":"BM Cat.

with white and yellow accessories. Above the designs, laurel-wreath; below, (a) palmettes, (b) maeander and crosses.\r\n(a) Dionysiac scene: In the centre is a couch covered with a panther's skin, on which is seated the youthful Dionysos to left, with long curls, large taenia tied round his head and myrtle-wreath, bordered himation over lower limbs, thyrsos with taenia fastened round it in left hand, which rests on cushions; in right he holds out a small white kylix by one finger inserted in the handle, as if about to throw the cottabos. By the side of the couch is a square table, on which are a situla and two fruit, and in front of the table a basket with fruit, and a white cottabos-stand. At the end of the couch stands a Maenad to right, with long curls, radiated ampyx, earrings, bracelets, long chiton and apoptygma, and himation over lower limbs and left arm, holding the top part of the stand with both hands. Behind her is a Satyr to right, with ivy-wreath, holding out an askos of skin in both hands, from which he pours water into a crater (shape as the vase itself) with a white taenia round the handles. The crater has black figures on a red ground, with a chevron moulding round the top; on the body, an athlete moving to left looking back, holding up a diskos in left hand; on the right is another athlete jumping, with right leg raised and arms extended. Below the Satyr is a ground-line indicated by white dots. Behind Dionysos is a Maenad to left, with hair in a loose knot, earrings, necklace, bracelets, long girt chiton with a stripe down the side, and apoptygma; her right hand is extended, and in left she holds up a tympanon. On the ground is a plant, and above a phiale, window, and taenia; above Dionysos, a female head to left, perhaps an oscillum, with long curls and embroidered white fillet, originally painted white. \r\n(b) In the centre is a female figure to right, with hair in a bunch at the back, long girt chiton and himation round body and over left arm; she holds up in right hand a wreath, and in left a large pyxis with maeander pattern, to an ephebos facing her, staff in hand, leaning against a stele on which is his himation. On the left is an ephebos to right, with himation over left shoulder, and staff in right hand; above him a window, and further to right an embroidered taenia suspended.","Producer name":"Attributed to: The Painter of Athens 1714","School\/style":null,"State":null,"Authority":null,"Ethnic name (made by)":null,"Ethnic name (assoc)":null,"Culture":"Apulian (Greek)","Production date":"370BC-360BC (circa)","Production place":"Made in: Puglia","Find spot":null,"Materials":"pottery","Ware":"Red Figure","Type series":null,"Technique":"painted","Dimensions":"Diameter: 39.37 centimetres; Height: 41.91 centimetres","Inscription":null,"Curators Comments":"BM Cat.

Above the designs, laurel-wreath; below, (a) palmettes, (b) maeander and crosses.\r\n(a) Dionysiac scene: In the centre is a couch covered with a panther's skin, on which is seated the youthful Dionysos to left, with long curls, large taenia tied round his head and myrtle-wreath, bordered himation over lower limbs, thyrsos with taenia fastened round it in left hand, which rests on cushions; in right he holds out a small white kylix by one finger inserted in the handle, as if about to throw the cottabos. By the side of the couch is a square table, on which are a situla and two fruit, and in front of the table a basket with fruit, and a white cottabos-stand. At the end of the couch stands a Maenad to right, with long curls, radiated ampyx, earrings, bracelets, long chiton and apoptygma, and himation over lower limbs and left arm, holding the top part of the stand with both hands. Behind her is a Satyr to right, with ivy-wreath, holding out an askos of skin in both hands, from which he pours water into a crater (shape as the vase itself) with a white taenia round the handles. The crater has black figures on a red ground, with a chevron moulding round the top; on the body, an athlete moving to left looking back, holding up a diskos in left hand; on the right is another athlete jumping, with right leg raised and arms extended. Below the Satyr is a ground-line indicated by white dots. Behind Dionysos is a Maenad to left, with hair in a loose knot, earrings, necklace, bracelets, long girt chiton with a stripe down the side, and apoptygma; her right hand is extended, and in left she holds up a tympanon. On the ground is a plant, and above a phiale, window, and taenia; above Dionysos, a female head to left, perhaps an oscillum, with long curls and embroidered white fillet, originally painted white. \r\n(b) In the centre is a female figure to right, with hair in a bunch at the back, long girt chiton and himation round body and over left arm; she holds up in right hand a wreath, and in left a large pyxis with maeander pattern, to an ephebos facing her, staff in hand, leaning against a stele on which is his himation. On the left is an ephebos to right, with himation over left shoulder, and staff in right hand; above him a window, and further to right an embroidered taenia suspended.","Producer name":"Attributed to: The Painter of Athens 1714","School\/style":null,"State":null,"Authority":null,"Ethnic name (made by)":null,"Ethnic name (assoc)":null,"Culture":"Apulian (Greek)","Production date":"370BC-360BC (circa)","Production place":"Made in: Puglia","Find spot":null,"Materials":"pottery","Ware":"Red Figure","Type series":null,"Technique":"painted","Dimensions":"Diameter: 39.37 centimetres; Height: 41.91 centimetres","Inscription":null,"Curators Comments":"BM Cat.

In front of it are two female attendants confronted; the one on the left holds up a large white fan in right hand and extends left hand to the other, whose hands are placed behind her head. The first wears earrings, double necklace, bracelets, long chiton and apoptygma to hips with border of dots, and sandals; her hair is gathered under a close cap. The other wears earrings, double necklace, long transparent chiton, and shoes; her hair rises in a mass over the forehead and falls on the shoulders. On the left is Phaedra, seated on a four-legged cushioned stool to right, with downcast face; her legs are crossed and her hands clasped on her right knee; her feet rest on a footstool. Her hair is gathered up under an ampyx and veil, and she wears earrings, double necklace, bracelets, long chiton, and sandals; behind her, above, hangs an Apulian sistrum, tied with a purple taenia. Before Phaedra hovers Eros to left, represented on a smaller scale, with long hair and sandals, holding out a taenia; behind her is the nurse to right, with white hair, long girt chiton, and himation, right hand supporting her chin, left extended. On the right is a paidagogos to right, with white hair and beard, short girt chiton, bordered himation, endromides with white tops turned over, and crook in left hand; his right hand is extended as if conversing with a female figure confronting him. She wears earrings, necklace, veil, long chiton, and himation; her right hand is placed under her chin. Above, behind the old man, hangs a cista, on which are painted human figures in white.\r\n2. Combat of Centaur and Lapithae: A Centaur advancing from right with wreath, panther-skin knotted in front, ridge of thick hair below waist, and a branch in left arm, seizes Laodameia by left arm and round neck; she has just stepped down to right from a chair, which has highly ornamented legs and cushion (as above). She has long hair with stephane, earrings, triple necklace, long transparent embroidered chiton, and sandals; her right foot is placed on a footstool, and she looks back at Peirithoos, who advances and seizes the Centaur's right arm. He is beardless, with short curly hair, chlamys over left arm, and sword in right hand. Above them is incised respectively: ΛΑΟΔΑΜΕΙΑ, Λαοδάμεια, and ΠΕΙΡIΘΟΟΣ, Πειρίθοος. Behind Peirithoos is a female figure retreating and looking back, with white taenia in her hair, long bordered chiton with apoptygma, and broad white scarf floating behind, sandals, bracelet on right arm; both hands are extended in astonishment. On the right Theseus advances, beardless, with chlamys over left arm, his left hand extended to seize the Centaur, whom he is about to strike with a club in right hand; he is inscribed: ΘΗΣΕΥΣ, Θήσευς. Behind him is a female figure retreating and looking back, with ampyx, hair tied in a knot with taenia, earrings, double necklace, bracelets, long chiton and himation drawn forward in left hand, and sandals. Below the Centaur is a yellow situla or cotyle. The ground-lines of both scenes are indicated by white dots.\r\n(b) Dionysiac group, in two rows: On the lower level, in the centre, on slightly raised ground, is a couch with embroidered hangings, on which Dionysos is seated, looking to left; he is beardless, with long hair, wreath, himation over lower limbs, and left leg doubled under him; his left arm rests on a purple embroidered cushion, and in right hand he holds out a white cantharos. At his feet is seated a female figure facing him; her hair is tied back with a string under an open cap radiated in front, and she wears double necklace, bracelet on left arm, long chiton, himation over lower limbs, and sandals; on her lap is a tympanon, and in right hand she holds out a small white prochoos. Behind her is a youthful Satyr, with fillet, bringing up a large crater (of the shape of the vase itself) in both hands; it is fluted at the top and bottom, and has three human figures painted on it, in white and yellow. Below the couch is Pan, represented on a smaller scale, beardless, and with goat's legs; he moves to left, with a branch in right hand and touches a dish of fruit with left; behind him is an incense-burner. Behind Dionysos stands a female figure with hair as the last, earrings, necklace, bracelets, long chiton, and apoptygma fastened on the shoulders, and drapery caught up over left arm; she holds up a wreath in right hand to crown Dionysos, and in her left is a thyrsos.\r\nAbove, in the centre, is the youthful Dionysos (?) seated to left, looking back, with fillet, anklets, sandals, and drapery beneath him; he holds out a phiale in right hand, and a thyrsos head downwards in left. Above him is a cluster of grapes, and on the left a tree. Beyond the tree is a female figure seated to left, looking back; her hair is tied in a knot with a string, and she wears radiated open cap, double necklace, bracelet on right arm, long girt chiton fastened on the shoulders, and sandals; thyrsos in right hand tied with a taenia, wreath in left. On the right is a similar female figure looking back (bracelet on left arm, no girdle, tympanon held up in left hand). The ground-lines are indicated throughout by white dots.","Producer name":"Attributed to: The Laodamia Painter","School\/style":null,"State":null,"Authority":null,"Ethnic name (made by)":null,"Ethnic name (assoc)":null,"Culture":"Apulian (Greek)","Production date":"350BC-340BC (circa)","Production place":"Made in: Puglia","Find spot":"Excavated\/Findspot: Anzi","Materials":"pottery","Ware":"Red Figure","Type series":null,"Technique":"painted","Dimensions":"Height: 76.20 centimetres","Inscription":"Inscription type: inscription","Curators Comments":"BM Cat.

water).\r\nDesigns black on red ground, with accessories of purple, white, and yellow. Above the designs, laurel-wreath; below, the vase is fluted.\r\n(a) 1. On the upper row: Phaedra's love-sickness: In the centre is a large couch, the legs inlaid with palmettes, and volutes and Gorgoneia above; along the front, spirals and other patterns; on the couch is a mattress with lozenge-pattern and an embroidered purple cushion at each end; beneath it is a large low stool with inlaid patterns in white, yellow, and purple. In front of it are two female attendants confronted; the one on the left holds up a large white fan in right hand and extends left hand to the other, whose hands are placed behind her head. The first wears earrings, double necklace, bracelets, long chiton and apoptygma to hips with border of dots, and sandals; her hair is gathered under a close cap. The other wears earrings, double necklace, long transparent chiton, and shoes; her hair rises in a mass over the forehead and falls on the shoulders. On the left is Phaedra, seated on a four-legged cushioned stool to right, with downcast face; her legs are crossed and her hands clasped on her right knee; her feet rest on a footstool. Her hair is gathered up under an ampyx and veil, and she wears earrings, double necklace, bracelets, long chiton, and sandals; behind her, above, hangs an Apulian sistrum, tied with a purple taenia. Before Phaedra hovers Eros to left, represented on a smaller scale, with long hair and sandals, holding out a taenia; behind her is the nurse to right, with white hair, long girt chiton, and himation, right hand supporting her chin, left extended. On the right is a paidagogos to right, with white hair and beard, short girt chiton, bordered himation, endromides with white tops turned over, and crook in left hand; his right hand is extended as if conversing with a female figure confronting him. She wears earrings, necklace, veil, long chiton, and himation; her right hand is placed under her chin. Above, behind the old man, hangs a cista, on which are painted human figures in white.\r\n2. Combat of Centaur and Lapithae: A Centaur advancing from right with wreath, panther-skin knotted in front, ridge of thick hair below waist, and a branch in left arm, seizes Laodameia by left arm and round neck; she has just stepped down to right from a chair, which has highly ornamented legs and cushion (as above). She has long hair with stephane, earrings, triple necklace, long transparent embroidered chiton, and sandals; her right foot is placed on a footstool, and she looks back at Peirithoos, who advances and seizes the Centaur's right arm. He is beardless, with short curly hair, chlamys over left arm, and sword in right hand. Above them is incised respectively: ΛΑΟΔΑΜΕΙΑ, Λαοδάμεια, and ΠΕΙΡIΘΟΟΣ, Πειρίθοος. Behind Peirithoos is a female figure retreating and looking back, with white taenia in her hair, long bordered chiton with apoptygma, and broad white scarf floating behind, sandals, bracelet on right arm; both hands are extended in astonishment. On the right Theseus advances, beardless, with chlamys over left arm, his left hand extended to seize the Centaur, whom he is about to strike with a club in right hand; he is inscribed: ΘΗΣΕΥΣ, Θήσευς. Behind him is a female figure retreating and looking back, with ampyx, hair tied in a knot with taenia, earrings, double necklace, bracelets, long chiton and himation drawn forward in left hand, and sandals. Below the Centaur is a yellow situla or cotyle. The ground-lines of both scenes are indicated by white dots.\r\n(b) Dionysiac group, in two rows: On the lower level, in the centre, on slightly raised ground, is a couch with embroidered hangings, on which Dionysos is seated, looking to left; he is beardless, with long hair, wreath, himation over lower limbs, and left leg doubled under him; his left arm rests on a purple embroidered cushion, and in right hand he holds out a white cantharos. At his feet is seated a female figure facing him; her hair is tied back with a string under an open cap radiated in front, and she wears double necklace, bracelet on left arm, long chiton, himation over lower limbs, and sandals; on her lap is a tympanon, and in right hand she holds out a small white prochoos. Behind her is a youthful Satyr, with fillet, bringing up a large crater (of the shape of the vase itself) in both hands; it is fluted at the top and bottom, and has three human figures painted on it, in white and yellow. Below the couch is Pan, represented on a smaller scale, beardless, and with goat's legs; he moves to left, with a branch in right hand and touches a dish of fruit with left; behind him is an incense-burner. Behind Dionysos stands a female figure with hair as the last, earrings, necklace, bracelets, long chiton, and apoptygma fastened on the shoulders, and drapery caught up over left arm; she holds up a wreath in right hand to crown Dionysos, and in her left is a thyrsos.\r\nAbove, in the centre, is the youthful Dionysos (?) seated to left, looking back, with fillet, anklets, sandals, and drapery beneath him; he holds out a phiale in right hand, and a thyrsos head downwards in left. Above him is a cluster of grapes, and on the left a tree. Beyond the tree is a female figure seated to left, looking back; her hair is tied in a knot with a string, and she wears radiated open cap, double necklace, bracelet on right arm, long girt chiton fastened on the shoulders, and sandals; thyrsos in right hand tied with a taenia, wreath in left. On the right is a similar female figure looking back (bracelet on left arm, no girdle, tympanon held up in left hand). The ground-lines are indicated throughout by white dots.","Producer name":"Attributed to: The Laodamia Painter","School\/style":null,"State":null,"Authority":null,"Ethnic name (made by)":null,"Ethnic name (assoc)":null,"Culture":"Apulian (Greek)","Production date":"350BC-340BC (circa)","Production place":"Made in: Puglia","Find spot":"Excavated\/Findspot: Anzi","Materials":"pottery","Ware":"Red Figure","Type series":null,"Technique":"painted","Dimensions":"Height: 76.20 centimetres","Inscription":"Inscription type: inscription","Curators Comments":"BM Cat.

type":"calyx-krater","Museum number":"No: 1856,1213.1","Title":null,"Denomination":null,"Escapement":null,"Description":"Pottery: red-figured calyx-krater.\r\nThe design forms two friezes around the body: on (a) above, the creation of Pandora, below, a chorus of Pans; on (b) above, a chorus of women, below, a family of satyrs playing ball. The friezes are divided by a band composed of pairs of maeanders separated by red cross squares; and a band of the same pattern below a and b occupy the obverse and reverse of the upper frieze, and have nothing between them at either end; c is below a and d below b; between c and d at each end is a double palmette, forming an ornament behind the handles. Above the design is a moulding with conventionalised dart and lotus pattern.\r\n(a) The making of Pandora. Pandora stands en face in the centre, a stiff and lifeless but complete figure of a woman, in long Doric chiton with apoptygma, fastened on each shoulder with a pin, with long hair and with a dotted fillet; her feet are close together, her hands at sides, each holding a wreath. Beside her, on left, Athene, in similar dress, with hair looped up, stephane, spear resting against her left shoulder, holds out in both hands towards Pandora a wreath. Next on left is Poseidon, bearded and wreathed, in an himation, with trident upright in left and right resting on his hip; he stands en face, but looks to left at Zeus, who, similarly dressed and wreathed, is seated towards him in a chair, holding sceptre in left and thunderbolt in right. Behind him Iris stands looking on, a youthful winged figure with short wavy hair, short tied chiton, and winged endromides, holding in her right a caduceus; her left hand, passed across her chest, is laid on her right shoulder. On the right of Pandora Ares moves to left in helmet, cuirass, short chiton, greaves, and mantle over arms, with shield (device, a four-spoked chariot-wheel, red on black) on left and spear in right; his helmet has the cheek-pieces lowered, and a dolphin (silhouette) plunging to right on the crown. He looks back to right at Hermes, who runs to right, looking back and holding out in right his caduceus towards Ares; he is beardless, with hair looped up over ears, petasos at back, chlamys, short tied chiton, and winged endromides. On right Hera stands to right, but looks to left, holding upright in her right a sceptre; she wears a long sleeved chiton, bordered himation, a modius decorated with two rows of dots, and earrings.\r\n(b) Girls dancing. On either side of a wreathed, beardless flute-player in a long dotted chiton with close-fitting sleeves reaching to the wrists, who plays his flutes to right, three girls are dancing. The nearest on right raises her right hand, and, resting en face on her left toes, draws the right toes backward along the ground, looking towards the flute-player. The next on right dances rapidly to left, looking back, with an arm extended on either side; the third dances towards her with left hand on hip and right arm extended. The girl on left of the flute-player dances to right, looking back, with right hand on hip and left arm extended to right. The next one dances to right, raising both arms; the last on the left dances rapidly to right, raising both arms, extended on a level with the shoulders with an action as of flying. Between these last two a bearded, wreathed man in an himation, holding a staff in right, stands to left. All the girls wear varieties of the Doric chiton, and a dotted saccos (or a broad band wound round, entirely covering the hair); the first and last described have cross-belts (stethodesma); the fourth has a diplois with a heavy embattled border above and below.\r\n(c) Satyric chorus. In the centre a wreathed youth in an himation stands to right, playing on the flutes; on each side of him two actors dressed as bearded Satyrs, with goat's feet, snub nose, and horns sprouting back from the centre of the forehead, dance with uncouth gestures. Each has, fastened around his middle, a black cloth to which is attached an erect phallos and a goat's tail.\r\n(d) Family of Satyrs at play. On the left a bearded, wreathed Satyr, wearing a himation, leans forward against a staff, holding in his right a large ball, which he is about to throw towards four bearded Satyrs on right; of these two bend forward to left, with hands on knees, and on their shoulders the other two are seated, holding out both hands prepared to catch the ball. Between the draped Satyr and the players stand on left an infant Satyr en face looking to right, with bowling-hoop in left hand; and on right a Maenad, also en face and looking to right, with long chiton, over which a panther-skin is knotted, long hair wreathed, and thyrsos held upright in left; she raises her right hand. \r\nPurple flames of thunderbolt and fillets. Brown inner markings and wash for panther-skin. \r\nOn the bottom of the foot incised characters.","Producer name":"Painted by: The Niobid Painter","School\/style":null,"State":null,"Authority":null,"Ethnic name (made by)":null,"Ethnic name (assoc)":null,"Culture":"Attic","Production date":"460BC-450BC (circa)","Production place":"Made in: Attica (Greece)","Find spot":"Excavated\/Findspot: Altamura","Materials":"pottery","Ware":"Red Figure","Type series":null,"Technique":"painted","Dimensions":"Diameter: 50 centimetres checked ; Height: 49 centimetres checked","Inscription":"Inscription type: merchant's mark Inscription position: under foot Inscription language: Greek Inscription script: Greek Inscription quoted: ΠOI and ligature Inscription transliteration: painted Inscription note: Graffito abbreviation of poikilos and ligature of alpha and rho plus.","Curators Comments":"BM Cat.

type":"calyx-krater","Museum number":"No: 1856,1213.1","Title":null,"Denomination":null,"Escapement":null,"Description":"Pottery: red-figured calyx-krater.\r\nThe design forms two friezes around the body: on (a) above, the creation of Pandora, below, a chorus of Pans; on (b) above, a chorus of women, below, a family of satyrs playing ball. The friezes are divided by a band composed of pairs of maeanders separated by red cross squares; and a band of the same pattern below a and b occupy the obverse and reverse of the upper frieze, and have nothing between them at either end; c is below a and d below b; between c and d at each end is a double palmette, forming an ornament behind the handles. Above the design is a moulding with conventionalised dart and lotus pattern.\r\n(a) The making of Pandora. Pandora stands en face in the centre, a stiff and lifeless but complete figure of a woman, in long Doric chiton with apoptygma, fastened on each shoulder with a pin, with long hair and with a dotted fillet; her feet are close together, her hands at sides, each holding a wreath. Beside her, on left, Athene, in similar dress, with hair looped up, stephane, spear resting against her left shoulder, holds out in both hands towards Pandora a wreath. Next on left is Poseidon, bearded and wreathed, in an himation, with trident upright in left and right resting on his hip; he stands en face, but looks to left at Zeus, who, similarly dressed and wreathed, is seated towards him in a chair, holding sceptre in left and thunderbolt in right. Behind him Iris stands looking on, a youthful winged figure with short wavy hair, short tied chiton, and winged endromides, holding in her right a caduceus; her left hand, passed across her chest, is laid on her right shoulder. On the right of Pandora Ares moves to left in helmet, cuirass, short chiton, greaves, and mantle over arms, with shield (device, a four-spoked chariot-wheel, red on black) on left and spear in right; his helmet has the cheek-pieces lowered, and a dolphin (silhouette) plunging to right on the crown. He looks back to right at Hermes, who runs to right, looking back and holding out in right his caduceus towards Ares; he is beardless, with hair looped up over ears, petasos at back, chlamys, short tied chiton, and winged endromides. On right Hera stands to right, but looks to left, holding upright in her right a sceptre; she wears a long sleeved chiton, bordered himation, a modius decorated with two rows of dots, and earrings.\r\n(b) Girls dancing. On either side of a wreathed, beardless flute-player in a long dotted chiton with close-fitting sleeves reaching to the wrists, who plays his flutes to right, three girls are dancing. The nearest on right raises her right hand, and, resting en face on her left toes, draws the right toes backward along the ground, looking towards the flute-player. The next on right dances rapidly to left, looking back, with an arm extended on either side; the third dances towards her with left hand on hip and right arm extended. The girl on left of the flute-player dances to right, looking back, with right hand on hip and left arm extended to right. The next one dances to right, raising both arms; the last on the left dances rapidly to right, raising both arms, extended on a level with the shoulders with an action as of flying. Between these last two a bearded, wreathed man in an himation, holding a staff in right, stands to left. All the girls wear varieties of the Doric chiton, and a dotted saccos (or a broad band wound round, entirely covering the hair); the first and last described have cross-belts (stethodesma); the fourth has a diplois with a heavy embattled border above and below.\r\n(c) Satyric chorus. In the centre a wreathed youth in an himation stands to right, playing on the flutes; on each side of him two actors dressed as bearded Satyrs, with goat's feet, snub nose, and horns sprouting back from the centre of the forehead, dance with uncouth gestures. Each has, fastened around his middle, a black cloth to which is attached an erect phallos and a goat's tail.\r\n(d) Family of Satyrs at play. On the left a bearded, wreathed Satyr, wearing a himation, leans forward against a staff, holding in his right a large ball, which he is about to throw towards four bearded Satyrs on right; of these two bend forward to left, with hands on knees, and on their shoulders the other two are seated, holding out both hands prepared to catch the ball. Between the draped Satyr and the players stand on left an infant Satyr en face looking to right, with bowling-hoop in left hand; and on right a Maenad, also en face and looking to right, with long chiton, over which a panther-skin is knotted, long hair wreathed, and thyrsos held upright in left; she raises her right hand. \r\nPurple flames of thunderbolt and fillets. Brown inner markings and wash for panther-skin. \r\nOn the bottom of the foot incised characters.","Producer name":"Painted by: The Niobid Painter","School\/style":null,"State":null,"Authority":null,"Ethnic name (made by)":null,"Ethnic name (assoc)":null,"Culture":"Attic","Production date":"460BC-450BC (circa)","Production place":"Made in: Attica (Greece)","Find spot":"Excavated\/Findspot: Altamura","Materials":"pottery","Ware":"Red Figure","Type series":null,"Technique":"painted","Dimensions":"Diameter: 50 centimetres checked ; Height: 49 centimetres checked","Inscription":"Inscription type: merchant's mark Inscription position: under foot Inscription language: Greek Inscription script: Greek Inscription quoted: ΠOI and ligature Inscription transliteration: painted Inscription note: Graffito abbreviation of poikilos and ligature of alpha and rho plus.","Curators Comments":"BM Cat.

type":"calyx-krater","Museum number":"No: 1856,1213.1","Title":null,"Denomination":null,"Escapement":null,"Description":"Pottery: red-figured calyx-krater.\r\nThe design forms two friezes around the body: on (a) above, the creation of Pandora, below, a chorus of Pans; on (b) above, a chorus of women, below, a family of satyrs playing ball. The friezes are divided by a band composed of pairs of maeanders separated by red cross squares; and a band of the same pattern below a and b occupy the obverse and reverse of the upper frieze, and have nothing between them at either end; c is below a and d below b; between c and d at each end is a double palmette, forming an ornament behind the handles. Above the design is a moulding with conventionalised dart and lotus pattern.\r\n(a) The making of Pandora. Pandora stands en face in the centre, a stiff and lifeless but complete figure of a woman, in long Doric chiton with apoptygma, fastened on each shoulder with a pin, with long hair and with a dotted fillet; her feet are close together, her hands at sides, each holding a wreath. Beside her, on left, Athene, in similar dress, with hair looped up, stephane, spear resting against her left shoulder, holds out in both hands towards Pandora a wreath. Next on left is Poseidon, bearded and wreathed, in an himation, with trident upright in left and right resting on his hip; he stands en face, but looks to left at Zeus, who, similarly dressed and wreathed, is seated towards him in a chair, holding sceptre in left and thunderbolt in right. Behind him Iris stands looking on, a youthful winged figure with short wavy hair, short tied chiton, and winged endromides, holding in her right a caduceus; her left hand, passed across her chest, is laid on her right shoulder. On the right of Pandora Ares moves to left in helmet, cuirass, short chiton, greaves, and mantle over arms, with shield (device, a four-spoked chariot-wheel, red on black) on left and spear in right; his helmet has the cheek-pieces lowered, and a dolphin (silhouette) plunging to right on the crown. He looks back to right at Hermes, who runs to right, looking back and holding out in right his caduceus towards Ares; he is beardless, with hair looped up over ears, petasos at back, chlamys, short tied chiton, and winged endromides. On right Hera stands to right, but looks to left, holding upright in her right a sceptre; she wears a long sleeved chiton, bordered himation, a modius decorated with two rows of dots, and earrings.\r\n(b) Girls dancing. On either side of a wreathed, beardless flute-player in a long dotted chiton with close-fitting sleeves reaching to the wrists, who plays his flutes to right, three girls are dancing. The nearest on right raises her right hand, and, resting en face on her left toes, draws the right toes backward along the ground, looking towards the flute-player. The next on right dances rapidly to left, looking back, with an arm extended on either side; the third dances towards her with left hand on hip and right arm extended. The girl on left of the flute-player dances to right, looking back, with right hand on hip and left arm extended to right. The next one dances to right, raising both arms; the last on the left dances rapidly to right, raising both arms, extended on a level with the shoulders with an action as of flying. Between these last two a bearded, wreathed man in an himation, holding a staff in right, stands to left. All the girls wear varieties of the Doric chiton, and a dotted saccos (or a broad band wound round, entirely covering the hair); the first and last described have cross-belts (stethodesma); the fourth has a diplois with a heavy embattled border above and below.\r\n(c) Satyric chorus. In the centre a wreathed youth in an himation stands to right, playing on the flutes; on each side of him two actors dressed as bearded Satyrs, with goat's feet, snub nose, and horns sprouting back from the centre of the forehead, dance with uncouth gestures. Each has, fastened around his middle, a black cloth to which is attached an erect phallos and a goat's tail.\r\n(d) Family of Satyrs at play. On the left a bearded, wreathed Satyr, wearing a himation, leans forward against a staff, holding in his right a large ball, which he is about to throw towards four bearded Satyrs on right; of these two bend forward to left, with hands on knees, and on their shoulders the other two are seated, holding out both hands prepared to catch the ball. Between the draped Satyr and the players stand on left an infant Satyr en face looking to right, with bowling-hoop in left hand; and on right a Maenad, also en face and looking to right, with long chiton, over which a panther-skin is knotted, long hair wreathed, and thyrsos held upright in left; she raises her right hand. \r\nPurple flames of thunderbolt and fillets. Brown inner markings and wash for panther-skin. \r\nOn the bottom of the foot incised characters.","Producer name":"Painted by: The Niobid Painter","School\/style":null,"State":null,"Authority":null,"Ethnic name (made by)":null,"Ethnic name (assoc)":null,"Culture":"Attic","Production date":"460BC-450BC (circa)","Production place":"Made in: Attica (Greece)","Find spot":"Excavated\/Findspot: Altamura","Materials":"pottery","Ware":"Red Figure","Type series":null,"Technique":"painted","Dimensions":"Diameter: 50 centimetres checked ; Height: 49 centimetres checked","Inscription":"Inscription type: merchant's mark Inscription position: under foot Inscription language: Greek Inscription script: Greek Inscription quoted: ΠOI and ligature Inscription transliteration: painted Inscription note: Graffito abbreviation of poikilos and ligature of alpha and rho plus.","Curators Comments":"BM Cat.

type":"calyx-krater","Museum number":"No: 1856,1213.1","Title":null,"Denomination":null,"Escapement":null,"Description":"Pottery: red-figured calyx-krater.\r\nThe design forms two friezes around the body: on (a) above, the creation of Pandora, below, a chorus of Pans; on (b) above, a chorus of women, below, a family of satyrs playing ball. The friezes are divided by a band composed of pairs of maeanders separated by red cross squares; and a band of the same pattern below a and b occupy the obverse and reverse of the upper frieze, and have nothing between them at either end; c is below a and d below b; between c and d at each end is a double palmette, forming an ornament behind the handles. Above the design is a moulding with conventionalised dart and lotus pattern.\r\n(a) The making of Pandora. Pandora stands en face in the centre, a stiff and lifeless but complete figure of a woman, in long Doric chiton with apoptygma, fastened on each shoulder with a pin, with long hair and with a dotted fillet; her feet are close together, her hands at sides, each holding a wreath. Beside her, on left, Athene, in similar dress, with hair looped up, stephane, spear resting against her left shoulder, holds out in both hands towards Pandora a wreath. Next on left is Poseidon, bearded and wreathed, in an himation, with trident upright in left and right resting on his hip; he stands en face, but looks to left at Zeus, who, similarly dressed and wreathed, is seated towards him in a chair, holding sceptre in left and thunderbolt in right. Behind him Iris stands looking on, a youthful winged figure with short wavy hair, short tied chiton, and winged endromides, holding in her right a caduceus; her left hand, passed across her chest, is laid on her right shoulder. On the right of Pandora Ares moves to left in helmet, cuirass, short chiton, greaves, and mantle over arms, with shield (device, a four-spoked chariot-wheel, red on black) on left and spear in right; his helmet has the cheek-pieces lowered, and a dolphin (silhouette) plunging to right on the crown. He looks back to right at Hermes, who runs to right, looking back and holding out in right his caduceus towards Ares; he is beardless, with hair looped up over ears, petasos at back, chlamys, short tied chiton, and winged endromides. On right Hera stands to right, but looks to left, holding upright in her right a sceptre; she wears a long sleeved chiton, bordered himation, a modius decorated with two rows of dots, and earrings.\r\n(b) Girls dancing. On either side of a wreathed, beardless flute-player in a long dotted chiton with close-fitting sleeves reaching to the wrists, who plays his flutes to right, three girls are dancing. The nearest on right raises her right hand, and, resting en face on her left toes, draws the right toes backward along the ground, looking towards the flute-player. The next on right dances rapidly to left, looking back, with an arm extended on either side; the third dances towards her with left hand on hip and right arm extended. The girl on left of the flute-player dances to right, looking back, with right hand on hip and left arm extended to right. The next one dances to right, raising both arms; the last on the left dances rapidly to right, raising both arms, extended on a level with the shoulders with an action as of flying. Between these last two a bearded, wreathed man in an himation, holding a staff in right, stands to left. All the girls wear varieties of the Doric chiton, and a dotted saccos (or a broad band wound round, entirely covering the hair); the first and last described have cross-belts (stethodesma); the fourth has a diplois with a heavy embattled border above and below.\r\n(c) Satyric chorus. In the centre a wreathed youth in an himation stands to right, playing on the flutes; on each side of him two actors dressed as bearded Satyrs, with goat's feet, snub nose, and horns sprouting back from the centre of the forehead, dance with uncouth gestures. Each has, fastened around his middle, a black cloth to which is attached an erect phallos and a goat's tail.\r\n(d) Family of Satyrs at play. On the left a bearded, wreathed Satyr, wearing a himation, leans forward against a staff, holding in his right a large ball, which he is about to throw towards four bearded Satyrs on right; of these two bend forward to left, with hands on knees, and on their shoulders the other two are seated, holding out both hands prepared to catch the ball. Between the draped Satyr and the players stand on left an infant Satyr en face looking to right, with bowling-hoop in left hand; and on right a Maenad, also en face and looking to right, with long chiton, over which a panther-skin is knotted, long hair wreathed, and thyrsos held upright in left; she raises her right hand. \r\nPurple flames of thunderbolt and fillets. Brown inner markings and wash for panther-skin. \r\nOn the bottom of the foot incised characters.","Producer name":"Painted by: The Niobid Painter","School\/style":null,"State":null,"Authority":null,"Ethnic name (made by)":null,"Ethnic name (assoc)":null,"Culture":"Attic","Production date":"460BC-450BC (circa)","Production place":"Made in: Attica (Greece)","Find spot":"Excavated\/Findspot: Altamura","Materials":"pottery","Ware":"Red Figure","Type series":null,"Technique":"painted","Dimensions":"Diameter: 50 centimetres checked ; Height: 49 centimetres checked","Inscription":"Inscription type: merchant's mark Inscription position: under foot Inscription language: Greek Inscription script: Greek Inscription quoted: ΠOI and ligature Inscription transliteration: painted Inscription note: Graffito abbreviation of poikilos and ligature of alpha and rho plus.","Curators Comments":"BM Cat.

The locality is indicated by a Doric column on the left, which extends to the upper border and supports an architrave with triglyphs; beside this is a chair, on which is a cushion with chevron ornaments. Next to it are two women (Muses?), who stand listening to a third, who is seated on a rock on the right. She sits to left with legs crossed, and left hand holding two flutes resting on her knee; with her right she clasps the mouthpiece of one flute. Her body and head are thrown slightly back, as if she were singing. She wears a Doric chiton with apoptygma tied, earrings, and a fillet, which is wound thrice round her looped-up hair; her mantle is spread beneath her on the rock. Confronting her, but with shoulders en face, is a woman in a long chiton, a mantle covering her left arm, a necklace, and saccos; her right hand seems to rest on her breast. The third figure leans against her, with her arms thrown round her neck and hands clasped on the further shoulder; she is dressed like the seated figure, but wears a radiated stephane. Above the seated woman hangs a chelys with six strings.\r\n(b) Musical scene. A woman on the right offers in her right a chelys to a girl of shorter stature, who confronts her, playing on the flutes, Each wears a long chiton and a mantle wrapped close, and has hair looped up behind with a fillet. The chiton of the flute-player is arranged in symmetrical groups of three folds, with crosses between. Between the figures is a square box, with lid on hinges open to left.\r\nLate stage of large style. Purple cord of lyre and fillet in b. Brown folds of chiton of central figure in a, edge of hair, and markings of rock. Eye in transition stage (both angles open). Below each side, pairs of maeander separated by red cross squares. Round the lip, on a moulding, a pattern of back-to-back palmettes, oblique.","Producer name":"Attributed to: The Niobid Painter","School\/style":null,"State":null,"Authority":null,"Ethnic name (made

The locality is indicated by a Doric column on the left, which extends to the upper border and supports an architrave with triglyphs; beside this is a chair, on which is a cushion with chevron ornaments. Next to it are two women (Muses?), who stand listening to a third, who is seated on a rock on the right. She sits to left with legs crossed, and left hand holding two flutes resting on her knee; with her right she clasps the mouthpiece of one flute. Her body and head are thrown slightly back, as if she were singing. She wears a Doric chiton with apoptygma tied, earrings, and a fillet, which is wound thrice round her looped-up hair; her mantle is spread beneath her on the rock. Confronting her, but with shoulders en face, is a woman in a long chiton, a mantle covering her left arm, a necklace, and saccos; her right hand seems to rest on her breast. The third figure leans against her, with her arms thrown round her neck and hands clasped on the further shoulder; she is dressed like the seated figure, but wears a radiated stephane. Above the seated woman hangs a chelys with six strings.\r\n(b) Musical scene. A woman on the right offers in her right a chelys to a girl of shorter stature, who confronts her, playing on the flutes, Each wears a long chiton and a mantle wrapped close, and has hair looped up behind with a fillet. The chiton of the flute-player is arranged in symmetrical groups of three folds, with crosses between. Between the figures is a square box, with lid on hinges open to left.\r\nLate stage of large style. Purple cord of lyre and fillet in b. Brown folds of chiton of central figure in a, edge of hair, and markings of rock. Eye in transition stage (both angles open). Below each side, pairs of maeander separated by red cross squares. Round the lip, on a moulding, a pattern of back-to-back palmettes, oblique.","Producer name":"Attributed to: The Niobid Painter","School\/style":null,"State":null,"Authority":null,"Ethnic name (made

type":"calyx-krater","Museum number":"No: 1842,0822.1","Title":null,"Denomination":null,"Escapement":null,"Description":"Pottery: red-figured calyx-krater.\r\n(a) Contest of Heracles and Apollo for the tripod. Heracles, nude and bearded, wearing only a fillet, moves to left with the tripod held across him in his left hand, so that the legs pass on each side of his body; he turns round as he moves, brandishing over his head in his right his club. Apollo strides forward, seizing with his left hand the lebes of the tripod, and with his right the club of his opponent; he also is nude, and wears his hair looped up (with a tress in front of the ear), and a laurel-wreath. Between them the fawn of Apollo looks up at the club of Heracles and shrinks backward. Each of the figures has a line drawn across the left ankle.\r\n(b) Acamas and Demophon bringing back Aethra. Aethra is represented as an old bent woman in a long spotted dress of Ionic form, with a broad black stripe down the centre, and a heavy mantle gathered up over her shoulders, her hair looped up with a narrow fillet: she walks to left with the aid of a crutched staff in her right hand; beside her face is her name, ΑΕΘΡΑ, Αεθρα. Her left wrist is grasped by the right hand of Demophon (χειρ έπί καρπω), who helps her along, looking round at her. On the left Acamas follows as the rear guard, looking round to left as if to guard against attack. Each of the warriors is bearded, and has a short chiton decorated with minute crosses, a cuirass with scale pattern, a mantle falling from the shoulders in pteryges, sword at side, long hair falling loose, helmet, shield, and spear; the helmet of Demophon has visor and raised cheek-pieces; his shield has the device (in black silhouette) of a Centaur on a plinth, galloping to left, swinging with both hands over his back a pine tree; his greaves are decorated with spirals; beside his head, ΔΕΜΟΘΟΝ, Αημόφων. Acamas has a helmet tilted back, and a shield which is black with a red rim, and has for device a red-figure Pegasos prancing to left. The lower edges of his greaves are indicated, but the artist seems to have omitted the remainder. Beside his head, AKAMAΣ, Ακαμας. On the foot, an incised character.\r\nPurple fillet, sword-belts, and inscriptions. The hair of Aethra has been painted white on black, with details in incised lines. Brown inner markings, pupil of eye; a brown wash is used for the coat of the fawn, the legs and ears (ωτα) of the tripod. The hair and beard of Heracles are indicated as short curls by raised dots of black paint. The eyes are in archaic type, with inner angle open; that of Heracles has a dotted pupil; both eyes in a have eyelashes along the upper and lower lids. The beards are long and wedge-shaped; nostrils indicated by a very faint black line; and the same is used for indicating the outline of the cheek of Aethra. The design is bordered above and below by a thin red line, within the moulding of the vase, the crest of Acamas alone exceeding it. At the bottom of the body is a band of tongue pattern.","Producer name":"Attributed to: Myson (painter)","School\/style":null,"State":null,"Authority":null,"Ethnic name (made by)":null,"Ethnic name (assoc)":null,"Culture":"Attic","Production date":"490BC-460BC (circa)","Production place":"Made in: Attica (Greece)","Find spot":null,"Materials":"pottery","Ware":"Red Figure","Type series":null,"Technique":"painted","Dimensions":"Diameter: 44.45 centimetres; Height: 40.64 centimetres","Inscription":"Inscription type: inscription Inscription position: under foot Inscription quoted: E Inscription note: Graffito E; Inscription type: inscription Inscription position: in field Inscription language: Greek Inscription script: Greek Inscription quoted: See description","Curators Comments":"BM Cat.

type":"calyx-krater","Museum number":"No: 1842,0822.1","Title":null,"Denomination":null,"Escapement":null,"Description":"Pottery: red-figured calyx-krater.\r\n(a) Contest of Heracles and Apollo for the tripod. Heracles, nude and bearded, wearing only a fillet, moves to left with the tripod held across him in his left hand, so that the legs pass on each side of his body; he turns round as he moves, brandishing over his head in his right his club. Apollo strides forward, seizing with his left hand the lebes of the tripod, and with his right the club of his opponent; he also is nude, and wears his hair looped up (with a tress in front of the ear), and a laurel-wreath. Between them the fawn of Apollo looks up at the club of Heracles and shrinks backward. Each of the figures has a line drawn across the left ankle.\r\n(b) Acamas and Demophon bringing back Aethra. Aethra is represented as an old bent woman in a long spotted dress of Ionic form, with a broad black stripe down the centre, and a heavy mantle gathered up over her shoulders, her hair looped up with a narrow fillet: she walks to left with the aid of a crutched staff in her right hand; beside her face is her name, ΑΕΘΡΑ, Αεθρα. Her left wrist is grasped by the right hand of Demophon (χειρ έπί καρπω), who helps her along, looking round at her. On the left Acamas follows as the rear guard, looking round to left as if to guard against attack. Each of the warriors is bearded, and has a short chiton decorated with minute crosses, a cuirass with scale pattern, a mantle falling from the shoulders in pteryges, sword at side, long hair falling loose, helmet, shield, and spear; the helmet of Demophon has visor and raised cheek-pieces; his shield has the device (in black silhouette) of a Centaur on a plinth, galloping to left, swinging with both hands over his back a pine tree; his greaves are decorated with spirals; beside his head, ΔΕΜΟΘΟΝ, Αημόφων. Acamas has a helmet tilted back, and a shield which is black with a red rim, and has for device a red-figure Pegasos prancing to left. The lower edges of his greaves are indicated, but the artist seems to have omitted the remainder. Beside his head, AKAMAΣ, Ακαμας. On the foot, an incised character.\r\nPurple fillet, sword-belts, and inscriptions. The hair of Aethra has been painted white on black, with details in incised lines. Brown inner markings, pupil of eye; a brown wash is used for the coat of the fawn, the legs and ears (ωτα) of the tripod. The hair and beard of Heracles are indicated as short curls by raised dots of black paint. The eyes are in archaic type, with inner angle open; that of Heracles has a dotted pupil; both eyes in a have eyelashes along the upper and lower lids. The beards are long and wedge-shaped; nostrils indicated by a very faint black line; and the same is used for indicating the outline of the cheek of Aethra. The design is bordered above and below by a thin red line, within the moulding of the vase, the crest of Acamas alone exceeding it. At the bottom of the body is a band of tongue pattern.","Producer name":"Attributed to: Myson (painter)","School\/style":null,"State":null,"Authority":null,"Ethnic name (made by)":null,"Ethnic name (assoc)":null,"Culture":"Attic","Production date":"490BC-460BC (circa)","Production place":"Made in: Attica (Greece)","Find spot":null,"Materials":"pottery","Ware":"Red Figure","Type series":null,"Technique":"painted","Dimensions":"Diameter: 44.45 centimetres; Height: 40.64 centimetres","Inscription":"Inscription type: inscription Inscription position: under foot Inscription quoted: E Inscription note: Graffito E; Inscription type: inscription Inscription position: in field Inscription language: Greek Inscription script: Greek Inscription quoted: See description","Curators Comments":"BM Cat.

red on black ground, with white accessories. Large style, bordering on the grotesque; faces to front, elaborate costumes, and dramatic action. Above the designs, laurel-wreath and egg-moulding; below each, egg-moulding and palmette-patterns.\r\n(a) Dolon surprised by Odysseus and Diomedes: In the centre is Dolon moving to left, crouching in an attitude of surprise, and looking round; he has a moustache and whiskers, skin helmet, short girt chiton over which is a spotted skin tied in front, and quiver with wave-pattern slung at left side. His endromides are of skin with tops turned over, laced in front and fastened by a broad strap under the instep, leaving the toes and heel bare. In left hand he holds up his bow, in  right he holds a spear which he endeavours to aim at Diomedes; the spear-head has a serrated edge. On either side, of him is a tree-trunk; on the left appears Odysseus, on the right Diomedes. Odysseus is bearded, and wears pilos, endromides of skin laced up in front, and chlamys with stripes and crenelle borders, and spots on the breast denoting fur (?), fastened with a fibula in front; he holds a short drawn sword in right hand, and his left hand is enveloped in a mantle and raised towards Dolon's  right shoulder. Diomedes seizes Dolon with right hand; he is bearded, and wears high-crested helmet (geison and cheek-pieces, crest supported on figure of crouching  wolf), endromides as Odysseus, chlamys with stripes and crenelle borders, fastened with a fibula in front and floating behind; in left hand two spears. The scene is closed in by a tree-trunk on either side.\r\n(b) Two groups: (1) Female figure to right, with short curly hair, necklace, long chiton, and bordered himation over left shoulder, holds out a wreath in right hand to a nude youth facing her, who holds out his right hand. (2) Female figure with hair in a knot, fillet wound round head, necklace, long girt chiton and apoptygma, holds out a wreath in right hand and an embroidered taenia in left to a youth wrapped in a himation. All four figures wear sandals.","Producer name":"Attributed to: The Dolon Painter","School\/style":null,"State":null,"Authority":null,"Ethnic name (made by)":null,"Ethnic name (assoc)":null,"Culture":"Lucanian (Greek)","Production date":"390BC-380BC (circa)","Production place":"Made in: Lucania (historic)","Find spot":"Excavated\/Findspot: Pisticci","Materials":"pottery","Ware":"Red Figure","Type series":null,"Technique":"painted","Dimensions":"Diameter: 48.26 centimetres; Height: 50.80 centimetres","Inscription":null,"Curators Comments":"See Trendell 1967, 1, p. 102, 533, pl. 52.3-4; also Trendell 1983, p. 59, D 21.

red on black ground, with white accessories. Large style, bordering on the grotesque; faces to front, elaborate costumes, and dramatic action. Above the designs, laurel-wreath and egg-moulding; below each, egg-moulding and palmette-patterns.\r\n(a) Dolon surprised by Odysseus and Diomedes: In the centre is Dolon moving to left, crouching in an attitude of surprise, and looking round; he has a moustache and whiskers, skin helmet, short girt chiton over which is a spotted skin tied in front, and quiver with wave-pattern slung at left side. His endromides are of skin with tops turned over, laced in front and fastened by a broad strap under the instep, leaving the toes and heel bare. In left hand he holds up his bow, in  right he holds a spear which he endeavours to aim at Diomedes; the spear-head has a serrated edge. On either side, of him is a tree-trunk; on the left appears Odysseus, on the right Diomedes. Odysseus is bearded, and wears pilos, endromides of skin laced up in front, and chlamys with stripes and crenelle borders, and spots on the breast denoting fur (?), fastened with a fibula in front; he holds a short drawn sword in right hand, and his left hand is enveloped in a mantle and raised towards Dolon's  right shoulder. Diomedes seizes Dolon with right hand; he is bearded, and wears high-crested helmet (geison and cheek-pieces, crest supported on figure of crouching  wolf), endromides as Odysseus, chlamys with stripes and crenelle borders, fastened with a fibula in front and floating behind; in left hand two spears. The scene is closed in by a tree-trunk on either side.\r\n(b) Two groups: (1) Female figure to right, with short curly hair, necklace, long chiton, and bordered himation over left shoulder, holds out a wreath in right hand to a nude youth facing her, who holds out his right hand. (2) Female figure with hair in a knot, fillet wound round head, necklace, long girt chiton and apoptygma, holds out a wreath in right hand and an embroidered taenia in left to a youth wrapped in a himation. All four figures wear sandals.","Producer name":"Attributed to: The Dolon Painter","School\/style":null,"State":null,"Authority":null,"Ethnic name (made by)":null,"Ethnic name (assoc)":null,"Culture":"Lucanian (Greek)","Production date":"390BC-380BC (circa)","Production place":"Made in: Lucania (historic)","Find spot":"Excavated\/Findspot: Pisticci","Materials":"pottery","Ware":"Red Figure","Type series":null,"Technique":"painted","Dimensions":"Diameter: 48.26 centimetres; Height: 50.80 centimetres","Inscription":null,"Curators Comments":"See Trendell 1967, 1, p. 102, 533, pl. 52.3-4; also Trendell 1983, p. 59, D 21.

Children disguised as satyrs with white hair (3 entire). No marking of grave number visible on the object itself.\n\nAttributions to find-spots are based on (1) Alfred Biliotti’s diary kept during excavations at Kamiros between November 1863 and June 1864, which records the contents of two votive deposits and over 300 graves; (2) entries in the Museum Register, often stipulating the find-spots of individual objects excavated by Biliotti; (3) the Kamiros tomb list, produced around the same time as his entries in the Museum Register. It lists the contents of each grave and votive deposit, along with their corresponding registration numbers; (4) the Kamiros index cards, written by Donald Bailey in the 1960’s. These mainly record the contents of graves from the Fikellura cemetery and are organised according to tomb group. All archives are kept in the Department of Greece and Rome. In addition, Reynold Higgins’ Catalogue of the Terracottas in the Department of Greek and Roman Antiquities (1954) has been checked for attributions to the Fikellura cemetery.","Bib references":"Vase

type":"cup","Museum number":"No: 1848,0619.7","Title":null,"Denomination":null,"Escapement":null,"Description":"Pottery: red-figured cup. \r\nINTERIOR:  symposiast and girl dancer. A youth reclines against a large striped cushion on a couch (only the horizontal board shown) to the left. He is named ΠΙLΙΠΟΣ (retr.; for Philippos). He wears a dotted himation with a black border on his left shoulder and over his lower body and has a red wreath in his hair. He grips a pair of pipes in his left hand and holds his right arm out straight to the left in what might be a gesture to stop. His mouth is open. In front of the couch, to the left, dances a very young girl, named ΚΑLLIΣΤΟ, who has straight short-cut hair and wears a transparent chiton and a red wreath in her hair. She lifts up her chiton with both hands so that it is slightly raised, either to facilitate her dance or to reveal her ankles. Her left foot is off the ground and she looks downwards. To the right the narrow end of a three-legged table is shown (the rest being cut off by the tondo frame) on which are a skyphos (black handle outwards) and four red garlands. In the background behind the youth his spotted flute-case {sybene) is suspended and his knotty stick leans against the border.\r\nBorder: groups of three units of stopt maeander (four-stroke, anticlockwise) alternating with dotted cross-squares.\r\nEXTERIOR:  symposium.\r\nSide A (upper): two symposiasts accompanied by two hetairai and a youth with a barbiton.\r\nOn the left a youth dressed in a himation (black border) and shoes leans against a fluted column with a plain block base and a Doric capital over a collar of ovolos. He has a red wreath in his blond hair (dilute glaze used) and holds out a barbiton (seven strings done in relief line) with both hands: a plektron (reserved handle; red end) is attached to its frame by a red cord (his chest and upper arms are lost). At the foot of the first couch sits a blond-haired hetaira wearing chiton, dotted himation with a battlement border, plain sakkos and disc earring, her feet resting on a plain block. She has a red wreath around her head and holds a large cup by the stem and one handle: on it is written KALE. She seems to look at the full cup with great concentration and her mouth is slightly open. Over the girl is written ΠILΟΝ KALΟΣ (for Philon). On the couch a youth reclines to the left, but turns his head back to the right, his mouth open. He wears a himation (battlement border at waist) and a thick reserved fillet, the tail of which he holds in his right hand. He leans against a striped cushion, his elbow actually on the turned post of the couch (all the couches on the exterior have dilute glaze strokes to indicate the grain of the wood). In front of his couch is a three-legged table. On the wall above his knee a footed food basket with red ties is suspended by a red loop. Over his head is written: ΔΕΜΟΝΙΚΟΣ. On the right stands a blond-haired woman wearing a chiton (dilute glaze folds on sleeves), a sakkos decorated with zigzags, a disc earring and a red wreath. She plays the pipes, a relief line to show that her cheeks are puffed. On the far right a bearded man reclines to the left. He wears a dotted himation and a red wreath. His left arm dangles down but his right holds a skyphos out to the right: his little finger juts out stiffly. In front of the couch is a three-legged table. Behind the pipe-player a knotty stick rests against the cushion of the first symposiast. Above his companion a footed food basket with red ties is hung from a red loop. Above him is written: ΑΡΙΣΤΟΚΡΑΤΕΣ.\r\nSide Β (lower): two symposiasts accompanied by two hetairai and a youth with a dipper and a strainer. On the extreme left is a fluted column with a plain block base and a Doric capital over an ovolo collar. A naked boy with a red wreath in his hair leans against it, his right leg flexed, his weight on his frontal left leg. He looks to the left, but his torso and left leg are frontal; his right leg is flexed behind so that it rests only on the toes. He holds a dipper with a long handle terminating in a duck's head and a strainer (the holes in the central perforated disc are done with dilute glaze). There is an accidental splash of added red on his left shoulder. Up on the right a food basket with red ties is suspended by a red loop and above it is written ΗΟΠΑΙΣΚΑLΟΣ. At the foot of the left-hand couch a woman sits on a plain stool with a plain cushion, playing the pipes. She is dressed in chiton (dilute glaze folds on the sleeves) and himation (black border) and has a red wreath around her short cut blond hair (dilute glaze). On the couch a bearded man reclines to the left. He has twisted his head and torso round to the right and holds out a skyphos in his right hand (little finger extended). He wears a dotted himation with a black border and has a red wreath in his hair. He leans against a striped cushion. Over his knee is hung a chelys lyre and under his couch rests a pair of boots (one in profile, one back view). Over his head is written his name: ΔΙΠΙLΟΣ (for Diphilos). Further to the right, beyond a spotted flute-case hanging in the field is written ΚΑLΟΣ. On the right hand couch are a hetaira and a youth. On the right is the youth, his dotted himation in disarray and his right foot raised. He has grasped the hetaira by her left wrist and has put his right hand on her left shoulder. He has a red wreath in his hair and leans against a striped cushion. His mouth is slightly open. The hetaira, who wears a chiton, girt at the waist with a black girdle, has her right hand under the youth's right elbow. Her right heel rests on the end of the couch; her left foot dangles beside it. Her hair has two wavy dilute lines below the main mass. Above and behind their legs a food basket with red ties hangs from a red loop; on the floor under the couch is an animal-legged footstool decorated with two stars — against it rests a pair of sandals (that in the centre seen from under the sole, that at the right hand end seen edge-on). Over their two heads is the inscription: ΝΙΚΟΠΙLΕ KALE (for Nikophile). \r\nGround line: double reserved line.\r\nRelief line contour throughout (except hair); dilute glaze for minor interior markings; thick reserved line inside lip, thin outside; added red for inscriptions.","Producer name":"Attributed to: The Brygos Painter","School\/style":null,"State":null,"Authority":null,"Ethnic name (made by)":null,"Ethnic name (assoc)":null,"Culture":"Attic","Production date":"490BC-480BC","Production place":"Made in: Attica (Greece)","Find spot":"Excavated\/Findspot: Vulci","Materials":"pottery","Ware":"Red Figure","Type series":null,"Technique":"painted","Dimensions":"Diameter: 13.90 centimetres of exterior ground line ; Diameter: 12 centimetres of foot ; Diameter: 17.30 centimetres of tondo ; Diameter: 31.90 centimetres; Height: 12.70 centimetres; Width: 39.70 centimetres","Inscription":"Inscription type: inscription Inscription position: in scenes Inscription language: Greek Inscription script: Greek Inscription quoted: Interior\r\n(1) ΠΙLΙΠΟΣ [named individual]\r\n(2) ΚΑLLIΣΤΟ [named individual] \r\nExterior:\r\nSide A\r\n(1) KALE [written on cup held by figure]\r\n(2) ΠILΟΝ KALΟΣ [named individual]\r\n(3) ΔΕΜΟΝΙΚΟΣ [named individual]\r\n(4)  ΑΡΙΣΤΟΚΡΑΤΕΣ.

Wernicke (Die griechischen Vasen mit Lieblingsnamen [Berlin 1890] 15) to Hieron, by F. Dümmler (Berlinerphilologische Wochenschrift 8 [1888] 20) to Brygos. Dümmler was followed by Hartwig and Hoppin; Beazley gave it to his Brygos Painter. It is an early mature work of the Brygos Painter and may be compared with pieces like the Louvre Iliupersis cup and the Würzburg komos cup (ARV2 369, 1; 372, 32). The potting has been attributed by Bloesch to Brygos.\r\nRelatively few straightforward symposium scenes by the Brygos Painter have survived (AKV2 372, 25, 26 and 28): on a Louvre fragment the symposium merges into love-making (ARV2 372, 30) and on the other London cup it devolves into a komos (Vase Ε71), while on a Cabinet des Medailles piece Herakles makes an entrance (ARV2 370, 8). The figure of the boy with dipper and strainer next to the column on side Β closely recalls the figure of a boy on a cup by the Foundry Painter (ARV2 401, 11: see VA 93). It also recalls the servant of Achilles on the Vienna skyphos (ARV2 380, 171) and the servant at the symposium on a cup by Makron (ARV2 478, 316).\r\nFor the barbiton and the chelys lyre see Maas and Mcintosh Snyder 79-112 and 113-38. For the plektron see most recently F. Jurgeit in Dohrn Festschrift 53-62. For the head-post of the couches on the exterior cf. the Chiusi cup (ARV2 389, 24), which may well be a work of the Brygos Painter himself. For food baskets with a small flat base see E.R. Knauer in Getty Vases 3, p. 95 fn. 12.\r\nFor Kallisto as a hetaira's name cf. Aelian Var. Hist. 13, 32; see further Peschel HSK 183-4. Diphilos kalos and Nikophile kale are so-called tag-kaloi (cf. Beazley ARV2 1574 and 1614; Peschel 396 note 245). For the name Nikophile see Peschel 184.\r\nFor the lack of aspiration (P for PH) on this cup see Hartwig Μ 319-21; P. Kretschmer, Die griechischen Vaseninschriften ihrer Sprache nach untersucht (Gütersloh 1894) 81; Cambitoglou Brygos Painter 11 with note 37; Immerwahr Attic Script 88. Immerwahr's suggestion that the lack of aspiration may have been intended to indicate that the symposiasts were drunk (more clearly on ARV2 376, 90) is to be preferred to the idea that the painter was a foreigner. On the status and origins of potters and painters see most recently D. Williams in A. Verbanck-Pierard and D. Vivier (eds.), Culture et Cité. L'avènement d’Athenes a l'époque archaique (Brussels 1995).","Bib references":"Vase \/ Catalogue of Vases in the British Museum; CVA British Museum 9 \/ Corpus Vasorum Antiquorum: Great Britain 17,

type":"cup","Museum number":"No: 1848,0619.7","Title":null,"Denomination":null,"Escapement":null,"Description":"Pottery: red-figured cup. \r\nINTERIOR:  symposiast and girl dancer. A youth reclines against a large striped cushion on a couch (only the horizontal board shown) to the left. He is named ΠΙLΙΠΟΣ (retr.; for Philippos). He wears a dotted himation with a black border on his left shoulder and over his lower body and has a red wreath in his hair. He grips a pair of pipes in his left hand and holds his right arm out straight to the left in what might be a gesture to stop. His mouth is open. In front of the couch, to the left, dances a very young girl, named ΚΑLLIΣΤΟ, who has straight short-cut hair and wears a transparent chiton and a red wreath in her hair. She lifts up her chiton with both hands so that it is slightly raised, either to facilitate her dance or to reveal her ankles. Her left foot is off the ground and she looks downwards. To the right the narrow end of a three-legged table is shown (the rest being cut off by the tondo frame) on which are a skyphos (black handle outwards) and four red garlands. In the background behind the youth his spotted flute-case {sybene) is suspended and his knotty stick leans against the border.\r\nBorder: groups of three units of stopt maeander (four-stroke, anticlockwise) alternating with dotted cross-squares.\r\nEXTERIOR:  symposium.\r\nSide A (upper): two symposiasts accompanied by two hetairai and a youth with a barbiton.\r\nOn the left a youth dressed in a himation (black border) and shoes leans against a fluted column with a plain block base and a Doric capital over a collar of ovolos. He has a red wreath in his blond hair (dilute glaze used) and holds out a barbiton (seven strings done in relief line) with both hands: a plektron (reserved handle; red end) is attached to its frame by a red cord (his chest and upper arms are lost). At the foot of the first couch sits a blond-haired hetaira wearing chiton, dotted himation with a battlement border, plain sakkos and disc earring, her feet resting on a plain block. She has a red wreath around her head and holds a large cup by the stem and one handle: on it is written KALE. She seems to look at the full cup with great concentration and her mouth is slightly open. Over the girl is written ΠILΟΝ KALΟΣ (for Philon). On the couch a youth reclines to the left, but turns his head back to the right, his mouth open. He wears a himation (battlement border at waist) and a thick reserved fillet, the tail of which he holds in his right hand. He leans against a striped cushion, his elbow actually on the turned post of the couch (all the couches on the exterior have dilute glaze strokes to indicate the grain of the wood). In front of his couch is a three-legged table. On the wall above his knee a footed food basket with red ties is suspended by a red loop. Over his head is written: ΔΕΜΟΝΙΚΟΣ. On the right stands a blond-haired woman wearing a chiton (dilute glaze folds on sleeves), a sakkos decorated with zigzags, a disc earring and a red wreath. She plays the pipes, a relief line to show that her cheeks are puffed. On the far right a bearded man reclines to the left. He wears a dotted himation and a red wreath. His left arm dangles down but his right holds a skyphos out to the right: his little finger juts out stiffly. In front of the couch is a three-legged table. Behind the pipe-player a knotty stick rests against the cushion of the first symposiast. Above his companion a footed food basket with red ties is hung from a red loop. Above him is written: ΑΡΙΣΤΟΚΡΑΤΕΣ.\r\nSide Β (lower): two symposiasts accompanied by two hetairai and a youth with a dipper and a strainer. On the extreme left is a fluted column with a plain block base and a Doric capital over an ovolo collar. A naked boy with a red wreath in his hair leans against it, his right leg flexed, his weight on his frontal left leg. He looks to the left, but his torso and left leg are frontal; his right leg is flexed behind so that it rests only on the toes. He holds a dipper with a long handle terminating in a duck's head and a strainer (the holes in the central perforated disc are done with dilute glaze). There is an accidental splash of added red on his left shoulder. Up on the right a food basket with red ties is suspended by a red loop and above it is written ΗΟΠΑΙΣΚΑLΟΣ. At the foot of the left-hand couch a woman sits on a plain stool with a plain cushion, playing the pipes. She is dressed in chiton (dilute glaze folds on the sleeves) and himation (black border) and has a red wreath around her short cut blond hair (dilute glaze). On the couch a bearded man reclines to the left. He has twisted his head and torso round to the right and holds out a skyphos in his right hand (little finger extended). He wears a dotted himation with a black border and has a red wreath in his hair. He leans against a striped cushion. Over his knee is hung a chelys lyre and under his couch rests a pair of boots (one in profile, one back view). Over his head is written his name: ΔΙΠΙLΟΣ (for Diphilos). Further to the right, beyond a spotted flute-case hanging in the field is written ΚΑLΟΣ. On the right hand couch are a hetaira and a youth. On the right is the youth, his dotted himation in disarray and his right foot raised. He has grasped the hetaira by her left wrist and has put his right hand on her left shoulder. He has a red wreath in his hair and leans against a striped cushion. His mouth is slightly open. The hetaira, who wears a chiton, girt at the waist with a black girdle, has her right hand under the youth's right elbow. Her right heel rests on the end of the couch; her left foot dangles beside it. Her hair has two wavy dilute lines below the main mass. Above and behind their legs a food basket with red ties hangs from a red loop; on the floor under the couch is an animal-legged footstool decorated with two stars — against it rests a pair of sandals (that in the centre seen from under the sole, that at the right hand end seen edge-on). Over their two heads is the inscription: ΝΙΚΟΠΙLΕ KALE (for Nikophile). \r\nGround line: double reserved line.\r\nRelief line contour throughout (except hair); dilute glaze for minor interior markings; thick reserved line inside lip, thin outside; added red for inscriptions.","Producer name":"Attributed to: The Brygos Painter","School\/style":null,"State":null,"Authority":null,"Ethnic name (made by)":null,"Ethnic name (assoc)":null,"Culture":"Attic","Production date":"490BC-480BC","Production place":"Made in: Attica (Greece)","Find spot":"Excavated\/Findspot: Vulci","Materials":"pottery","Ware":"Red Figure","Type series":null,"Technique":"painted","Dimensions":"Diameter: 13.90 centimetres of exterior ground line ; Diameter: 12 centimetres of foot ; Diameter: 17.30 centimetres of tondo ; Diameter: 31.90 centimetres; Height: 12.70 centimetres; Width: 39.70 centimetres","Inscription":"Inscription type: inscription Inscription position: in scenes Inscription language: Greek Inscription script: Greek Inscription quoted: Interior\r\n(1) ΠΙLΙΠΟΣ [named individual]\r\n(2) ΚΑLLIΣΤΟ [named individual] \r\nExterior:\r\nSide A\r\n(1) KALE [written on cup held by figure]\r\n(2) ΠILΟΝ KALΟΣ [named individual]\r\n(3) ΔΕΜΟΝΙΚΟΣ [named individual]\r\n(4)  ΑΡΙΣΤΟΚΡΑΤΕΣ.

Wernicke (Die griechischen Vasen mit Lieblingsnamen [Berlin 1890] 15) to Hieron, by F. Dümmler (Berlinerphilologische Wochenschrift 8 [1888] 20) to Brygos. Dümmler was followed by Hartwig and Hoppin; Beazley gave it to his Brygos Painter. It is an early mature work of the Brygos Painter and may be compared with pieces like the Louvre Iliupersis cup and the Würzburg komos cup (ARV2 369, 1; 372, 32). The potting has been attributed by Bloesch to Brygos.\r\nRelatively few straightforward symposium scenes by the Brygos Painter have survived (AKV2 372, 25, 26 and 28): on a Louvre fragment the symposium merges into love-making (ARV2 372, 30) and on the other London cup it devolves into a komos (Vase Ε71), while on a Cabinet des Medailles piece Herakles makes an entrance (ARV2 370, 8). The figure of the boy with dipper and strainer next to the column on side Β closely recalls the figure of a boy on a cup by the Foundry Painter (ARV2 401, 11: see VA 93). It also recalls the servant of Achilles on the Vienna skyphos (ARV2 380, 171) and the servant at the symposium on a cup by Makron (ARV2 478, 316).\r\nFor the barbiton and the chelys lyre see Maas and Mcintosh Snyder 79-112 and 113-38. For the plektron see most recently F. Jurgeit in Dohrn Festschrift 53-62. For the head-post of the couches on the exterior cf. the Chiusi cup (ARV2 389, 24), which may well be a work of the Brygos Painter himself. For food baskets with a small flat base see E.R. Knauer in Getty Vases 3, p. 95 fn. 12.\r\nFor Kallisto as a hetaira's name cf. Aelian Var. Hist. 13, 32; see further Peschel HSK 183-4. Diphilos kalos and Nikophile kale are so-called tag-kaloi (cf. Beazley ARV2 1574 and 1614; Peschel 396 note 245). For the name Nikophile see Peschel 184.\r\nFor the lack of aspiration (P for PH) on this cup see Hartwig Μ 319-21; P. Kretschmer, Die griechischen Vaseninschriften ihrer Sprache nach untersucht (Gütersloh 1894) 81; Cambitoglou Brygos Painter 11 with note 37; Immerwahr Attic Script 88. Immerwahr's suggestion that the lack of aspiration may have been intended to indicate that the symposiasts were drunk (more clearly on ARV2 376, 90) is to be preferred to the idea that the painter was a foreigner. On the status and origins of potters and painters see most recently D. Williams in A. Verbanck-Pierard and D. Vivier (eds.), Culture et Cité. L'avènement d’Athenes a l'époque archaique (Brussels 1995).","Bib references":"Vase \/ Catalogue of Vases in the British Museum; CVA British Museum 9 \/ Corpus Vasorum Antiquorum: Great Britain 17,

A youth reclines against a large striped cushion on a couch (only the horizontal board shown) to the left. He is named ΠΙLΙΠΟΣ (retr.; for Philippos). He wears a dotted himation with a black border on his left shoulder and over his lower body and has a red wreath in his hair. He grips a pair of pipes in his left hand and holds his right arm out straight to the left in what might be a gesture to stop. His mouth is open. In front of the couch, to the left, dances a very young girl, named ΚΑLLIΣΤΟ, who has straight short-cut hair and wears a transparent chiton and a red wreath in her hair. She lifts up her chiton with both hands so that it is slightly raised, either to facilitate her dance or to reveal her ankles. Her left foot is off the ground and she looks downwards. To the right the narrow end of a three-legged table is shown (the rest being cut off by the tondo frame) on which are a skyphos (black handle outwards) and four red garlands. In the background behind the youth his spotted flute-case {sybene) is suspended and his knotty stick leans against the border.\r\nBorder: groups of three units of stopt maeander (four-stroke, anticlockwise) alternating with dotted cross-squares.\r\nEXTERIOR:  symposium.\r\nSide A (upper): two symposiasts accompanied by two hetairai and a youth with a barbiton.\r\nOn the left a youth dressed in a himation (black border) and shoes leans against a fluted column with a plain block base and a Doric capital over a collar of ovolos. He has a red wreath in his blond hair (dilute glaze used) and holds out a barbiton (seven strings done in relief line) with both hands: a plektron (reserved handle; red end) is attached to its frame by a red cord (his chest and upper arms are lost). At the foot of the first couch sits a blond-haired hetaira wearing chiton, dotted himation with a battlement border, plain sakkos and disc earring, her feet resting on a plain block. She has a red wreath around her head and holds a large cup by the stem and one handle: on it is written KALE. She seems to look at the full cup with great concentration and her mouth is slightly open. Over the girl is written ΠILΟΝ KALΟΣ (for Philon). On the couch a youth reclines to the left, but turns his head back to the right, his mouth open. He wears a himation (battlement border at waist) and a thick reserved fillet, the tail of which he holds in his right hand. He leans against a striped cushion, his elbow actually on the turned post of the couch (all the couches on the exterior have dilute glaze strokes to indicate the grain of the wood). In front of his couch is a three-legged table. On the wall above his knee a footed food basket with red ties is suspended by a red loop. Over his head is written: ΔΕΜΟΝΙΚΟΣ. On the right stands a blond-haired woman wearing a chiton (dilute glaze folds on sleeves), a sakkos decorated with zigzags, a disc earring and a red wreath. She plays the pipes, a relief line to show that her cheeks are puffed. On the far right a bearded man reclines to the left. He wears a dotted himation and a red wreath. His left arm dangles down but his right holds a skyphos out to the right: his little finger juts out stiffly. In front of the couch is a three-legged table. Behind the pipe-player a knotty stick rests against the cushion of the first symposiast. Above his companion a footed food basket with red ties is hung from a red loop. Above him is written: ΑΡΙΣΤΟΚΡΑΤΕΣ.\r\nSide Β (lower): two symposiasts accompanied by two hetairai and a youth with a dipper and a strainer. On the extreme left is a fluted column with a plain block base and a Doric capital over an ovolo collar. A naked boy with a red wreath in his hair leans against it, his right leg flexed, his weight on his frontal left leg. He looks to the left, but his torso and left leg are frontal; his right leg is flexed behind so that it rests only on the toes. He holds a dipper with a long handle terminating in a duck's head and a strainer (the holes in the central perforated disc are done with dilute glaze). There is an accidental splash of added red on his left shoulder. Up on the right a food basket with red ties is suspended by a red loop and above it is written ΗΟΠΑΙΣΚΑLΟΣ. At the foot of the left-hand couch a woman sits on a plain stool with a plain cushion, playing the pipes. She is dressed in chiton (dilute glaze folds on the sleeves) and himation (black border) and has a red wreath around her short cut blond hair (dilute glaze). On the couch a bearded man reclines to the left. He has twisted his head and torso round to the right and holds out a skyphos in his right hand (little finger extended). He wears a dotted himation with a black border and has a red wreath in his hair. He leans against a striped cushion. Over his knee is hung a chelys lyre and under his couch rests a pair of boots (one in profile, one back view). Over his head is written his name: ΔΙΠΙLΟΣ (for Diphilos). Further to the right, beyond a spotted flute-case hanging in the field is written ΚΑLΟΣ. On the right hand couch are a hetaira and a youth. On the right is the youth, his dotted himation in disarray and his right foot raised. He has grasped the hetaira by her left wrist and has put his right hand on her left shoulder. He has a red wreath in his hair and leans against a striped cushion. His mouth is slightly open. The hetaira, who wears a chiton, girt at the waist with a black girdle, has her right hand under the youth's right elbow. Her right heel rests on the end of the couch; her left foot dangles beside it. Her hair has two wavy dilute lines below the main mass. Above and behind their legs a food basket with red ties hangs from a red loop; on the floor under the couch is an animal-legged footstool decorated with two stars — against it rests a pair of sandals (that in the centre seen from under the sole, that at the right hand end seen edge-on). Over their two heads is the inscription: ΝΙΚΟΠΙLΕ KALE (for Nikophile). \r\nGround line: double reserved line.\r\nRelief line contour throughout (except hair); dilute glaze for minor interior markings; thick reserved line inside lip, thin outside; added red for inscriptions.","Producer name":"Attributed to: The Brygos Painter","School\/style":null,"State":null,"Authority":null,"Ethnic name (made by)":null,"Ethnic name (assoc)":null,"Culture":"Attic","Production date":"490BC-480BC","Production place":"Made in: Attica (Greece)","Find spot":"Excavated\/Findspot: Vulci","Materials":"pottery","Ware":"Red Figure","Type series":null,"Technique":"painted","Dimensions":"Diameter: 13.90 centimetres of exterior ground line ; Diameter: 12 centimetres of foot ; Diameter: 17.30 centimetres of tondo ; Diameter: 31.90 centimetres; Height: 12.70 centimetres; Width: 39.70 centimetres","Inscription":"Inscription type: inscription Inscription position: in scenes Inscription language: Greek Inscription script: Greek Inscription quoted: Interior\r\n(1) ΠΙLΙΠΟΣ [named individual]\r\n(2) ΚΑLLIΣΤΟ [named individual] \r\nExterior:\r\nSide A\r\n(1) KALE [written on cup held by figure]\r\n(2) ΠILΟΝ KALΟΣ [named individual]\r\n(3) ΔΕΜΟΝΙΚΟΣ [named individual]\r\n(4)  ΑΡΙΣΤΟΚΡΑΤΕΣ.

Wernicke (Die griechischen Vasen mit Lieblingsnamen [Berlin 1890] 15) to Hieron, by F. Dümmler (Berlinerphilologische Wochenschrift 8 [1888] 20) to Brygos. Dümmler was followed by Hartwig and Hoppin; Beazley gave it to his Brygos Painter. It is an early mature work of the Brygos Painter and may be compared with pieces like the Louvre Iliupersis cup and the Würzburg komos cup (ARV2 369, 1; 372, 32). The potting has been attributed by Bloesch to Brygos.\r\nRelatively few straightforward symposium scenes by the Brygos Painter have survived (AKV2 372, 25, 26 and 28): on a Louvre fragment the symposium merges into love-making (ARV2 372, 30) and on the other London cup it devolves into a komos (Vase Ε71), while on a Cabinet des Medailles piece Herakles makes an entrance (ARV2 370, 8). The figure of the boy with dipper and strainer next to the column on side Β closely recalls the figure of a boy on a cup by the Foundry Painter (ARV2 401, 11: see VA 93). It also recalls the servant of Achilles on the Vienna skyphos (ARV2 380, 171) and the servant at the symposium on a cup by Makron (ARV2 478, 316).\r\nFor the barbiton and the chelys lyre see Maas and Mcintosh Snyder 79-112 and 113-38. For the plektron see most recently F. Jurgeit in Dohrn Festschrift 53-62. For the head-post of the couches on the exterior cf. the Chiusi cup (ARV2 389, 24), which may well be a work of the Brygos Painter himself. For food baskets with a small flat base see E.R. Knauer in Getty Vases 3, p. 95 fn. 12.\r\nFor Kallisto as a hetaira's name cf. Aelian Var. Hist. 13, 32; see further Peschel HSK 183-4. Diphilos kalos and Nikophile kale are so-called tag-kaloi (cf. Beazley ARV2 1574 and 1614; Peschel 396 note 245). For the name Nikophile see Peschel 184.\r\nFor the lack of aspiration (P for PH) on this cup see Hartwig Μ 319-21; P. Kretschmer, Die griechischen Vaseninschriften ihrer Sprache nach untersucht (Gütersloh 1894) 81; Cambitoglou Brygos Painter 11 with note 37; Immerwahr Attic Script 88. Immerwahr's suggestion that the lack of aspiration may have been intended to indicate that the symposiasts were drunk (more clearly on ARV2 376, 90) is to be preferred to the idea that the painter was a foreigner. On the status and origins of potters and painters see most recently D. Williams in A. Verbanck-Pierard and D. Vivier (eds.), Culture et Cité. L'avènement d’Athenes a l'époque archaique (Brussels 1995).","Bib references":"Vase \/ Catalogue of Vases in the British Museum; CVA British Museum 9 \/ Corpus Vasorum Antiquorum: Great Britain 17,

A youth reclines against a large striped cushion on a couch (only the horizontal board shown) to the left. He is named ΠΙLΙΠΟΣ (retr.; for Philippos). He wears a dotted himation with a black border on his left shoulder and over his lower body and has a red wreath in his hair. He grips a pair of pipes in his left hand and holds his right arm out straight to the left in what might be a gesture to stop. His mouth is open. In front of the couch, to the left, dances a very young girl, named ΚΑLLIΣΤΟ, who has straight short-cut hair and wears a transparent chiton and a red wreath in her hair. She lifts up her chiton with both hands so that it is slightly raised, either to facilitate her dance or to reveal her ankles. Her left foot is off the ground and she looks downwards. To the right the narrow end of a three-legged table is shown (the rest being cut off by the tondo frame) on which are a skyphos (black handle outwards) and four red garlands. In the background behind the youth his spotted flute-case {sybene) is suspended and his knotty stick leans against the border.\r\nBorder: groups of three units of stopt maeander (four-stroke, anticlockwise) alternating with dotted cross-squares.\r\nEXTERIOR:  symposium.\r\nSide A (upper): two symposiasts accompanied by two hetairai and a youth with a barbiton.\r\nOn the left a youth dressed in a himation (black border) and shoes leans against a fluted column with a plain block base and a Doric capital over a collar of ovolos. He has a red wreath in his blond hair (dilute glaze used) and holds out a barbiton (seven strings done in relief line) with both hands: a plektron (reserved handle; red end) is attached to its frame by a red cord (his chest and upper arms are lost). At the foot of the first couch sits a blond-haired hetaira wearing chiton, dotted himation with a battlement border, plain sakkos and disc earring, her feet resting on a plain block. She has a red wreath around her head and holds a large cup by the stem and one handle: on it is written KALE. She seems to look at the full cup with great concentration and her mouth is slightly open. Over the girl is written ΠILΟΝ KALΟΣ (for Philon). On the couch a youth reclines to the left, but turns his head back to the right, his mouth open. He wears a himation (battlement border at waist) and a thick reserved fillet, the tail of which he holds in his right hand. He leans against a striped cushion, his elbow actually on the turned post of the couch (all the couches on the exterior have dilute glaze strokes to indicate the grain of the wood). In front of his couch is a three-legged table. On the wall above his knee a footed food basket with red ties is suspended by a red loop. Over his head is written: ΔΕΜΟΝΙΚΟΣ. On the right stands a blond-haired woman wearing a chiton (dilute glaze folds on sleeves), a sakkos decorated with zigzags, a disc earring and a red wreath. She plays the pipes, a relief line to show that her cheeks are puffed. On the far right a bearded man reclines to the left. He wears a dotted himation and a red wreath. His left arm dangles down but his right holds a skyphos out to the right: his little finger juts out stiffly. In front of the couch is a three-legged table. Behind the pipe-player a knotty stick rests against the cushion of the first symposiast. Above his companion a footed food basket with red ties is hung from a red loop. Above him is written: ΑΡΙΣΤΟΚΡΑΤΕΣ.\r\nSide Β (lower): two symposiasts accompanied by two hetairai and a youth with a dipper and a strainer. On the extreme left is a fluted column with a plain block base and a Doric capital over an ovolo collar. A naked boy with a red wreath in his hair leans against it, his right leg flexed, his weight on his frontal left leg. He looks to the left, but his torso and left leg are frontal; his right leg is flexed behind so that it rests only on the toes. He holds a dipper with a long handle terminating in a duck's head and a strainer (the holes in the central perforated disc are done with dilute glaze). There is an accidental splash of added red on his left shoulder. Up on the right a food basket with red ties is suspended by a red loop and above it is written ΗΟΠΑΙΣΚΑLΟΣ. At the foot of the left-hand couch a woman sits on a plain stool with a plain cushion, playing the pipes. She is dressed in chiton (dilute glaze folds on the sleeves) and himation (black border) and has a red wreath around her short cut blond hair (dilute glaze). On the couch a bearded man reclines to the left. He has twisted his head and torso round to the right and holds out a skyphos in his right hand (little finger extended). He wears a dotted himation with a black border and has a red wreath in his hair. He leans against a striped cushion. Over his knee is hung a chelys lyre and under his couch rests a pair of boots (one in profile, one back view). Over his head is written his name: ΔΙΠΙLΟΣ (for Diphilos). Further to the right, beyond a spotted flute-case hanging in the field is written ΚΑLΟΣ. On the right hand couch are a hetaira and a youth. On the right is the youth, his dotted himation in disarray and his right foot raised. He has grasped the hetaira by her left wrist and has put his right hand on her left shoulder. He has a red wreath in his hair and leans against a striped cushion. His mouth is slightly open. The hetaira, who wears a chiton, girt at the waist with a black girdle, has her right hand under the youth's right elbow. Her right heel rests on the end of the couch; her left foot dangles beside it. Her hair has two wavy dilute lines below the main mass. Above and behind their legs a food basket with red ties hangs from a red loop; on the floor under the couch is an animal-legged footstool decorated with two stars — against it rests a pair of sandals (that in the centre seen from under the sole, that at the right hand end seen edge-on).

Wernicke (Die griechischen Vasen mit Lieblingsnamen [Berlin 1890] 15) to Hieron, by F. Dümmler (Berlinerphilologische Wochenschrift 8 [1888] 20) to Brygos. Dümmler was followed by Hartwig and Hoppin; Beazley gave it to his Brygos Painter. It is an early mature work of the Brygos Painter and may be compared with pieces like the Louvre Iliupersis cup and the Würzburg komos cup (ARV2 369, 1; 372, 32). The potting has been attributed by Bloesch to Brygos.\r\nRelatively few straightforward symposium scenes by the Brygos Painter have survived (AKV2 372, 25, 26 and 28): on a Louvre fragment the symposium merges into love-making (ARV2 372, 30) and on the other London cup it devolves into a komos (Vase Ε71), while on a Cabinet des Medailles piece Herakles makes an entrance (ARV2 370, 8). The figure of the boy with dipper and strainer next to the column on side Β closely recalls the figure of a boy on a cup by the Foundry Painter (ARV2 401, 11: see VA 93). It also recalls the servant of Achilles on the Vienna skyphos (ARV2 380, 171) and the servant at the symposium on a cup by Makron (ARV2 478, 316).\r\nFor the barbiton and the chelys lyre see Maas and Mcintosh Snyder 79-112 and 113-38. For the plektron see most recently F. Jurgeit in Dohrn Festschrift 53-62. For the head-post of the couches on the exterior cf. the Chiusi cup (ARV2 389, 24), which may well be a work of the Brygos Painter himself. For food baskets with a small flat base see E.R. Knauer in Getty Vases 3, p. 95 fn. 12.\r\nFor Kallisto as a hetaira's name cf. Aelian Var. Hist. 13, 32; see further Peschel HSK 183-4. Diphilos kalos and Nikophile kale are so-called tag-kaloi (cf. Beazley ARV2 1574 and 1614; Peschel 396 note 245). For the name Nikophile see Peschel 184.\r\nFor the lack of aspiration (P for PH) on this cup see Hartwig Μ 319-21; P. Kretschmer, Die griechischen Vaseninschriften ihrer Sprache nach untersucht (Gütersloh 1894) 81; Cambitoglou Brygos Painter 11 with note 37; Immerwahr Attic Script 88. Immerwahr's suggestion that the lack of aspiration may have been intended to indicate that the symposiasts were drunk (more clearly on ARV2 376, 90) is to be preferred to the idea that the painter was a foreigner. On the status and origins of potters and painters see most recently D. Williams in A. Verbanck-Pierard and D. Vivier (eds.), Culture et Cité. L'avènement d’Athenes a l'époque archaique (Brussels 1995).","Bib references":"Vase \/ Catalogue of Vases in the British Museum; CVA British Museum 9 \/ Corpus Vasorum Antiquorum: Great Britain 17,

A bearded man stands to the left, but turns his head back to the right. Relief lines over brow and along neck contour; relief line curl under front of beard. His chest is shown frontal. He wears a himation which is draped over his left shoulder and a red apicate fillet in his hair. He holds a knotty stick in his right hand; his left arm, probably akimbo, is hidden in his himation. On the right a sponge, aryballos and, in front, a net bag with a tail hang from a red loop.\r\nBorder: alternating spiral maeander (twelve-stroke core; alternately clockwise and anticlockwise; additional unit at one o'clock) and blackened cross-square.\r\nEXTERIOR:  victor, youths, boys and men.\r\nSide A (upper): victor, youth, boy and two men. On the left a youth in a himation holds out a red circlet in his hands towards a boy. The youth has a red apicate fillet in his own hair (relief line strokes over brow and neck) and a plain stick rests loosely against his arm and chest. The naked boy facing him already has a long red fillet with loop and ties in his hair (relief lines over brow) and a second, longer and thicker one, a tainia, is tied round the biceps of his left arm and trails on the ground. In either hand he holds a red branch, perhaps of olive. In the centre stands a himation-clad man leaning to the right on a plain stick and holding out a small red flower in his right hand to a boy. The latter figure, also clad in himation holds out a small red flower too. Both figures have red apicate fillets in their hair (relief lines in hair as Ai). On the far right is a man in a himation leaning on a knotty stick. Under his left arm is tucked a pad of drapery that loops over his forearm, and his back is shown in three-quarter view. He holds a small red flower in his left hand and has a red apicate fillet in his hair (relief lines in hair as on Ai).\r\nSide Β (lower): three youths and two boys. On the left a youth in a himation stands to the left but with his head turned back to the right (front of head missing; relief lines in hair as interior). He has a red fillet in his hair and holds a knotty stick in his right hand. In front of him hang a sponge, an aryballos and a net bag. A boy, closely wrapped in a himation, faces him, a red apicate fillet in his hair (relief lines in hair as interior). In the centre stands a youth, his right leg and torso frontal, his head turned to the left. He wears a himation and a red apicate fillet in his hair (relief lines in hair as interior) and in his left hand holds a plain stick that crosses his body. He holds up his right hand with fingers spread. A boy moves towards him, but turns his head back to the right. A himation is draped over his left shoulder, but his right hand holds a bunch of folds so that most of his body is revealed. He has a red apicate fillet in his hair (relief lines in hair as interior). On the far right stands a youth in a himation and red apicate fillet, holding a plain stick in his right hand.\r\nAt either handle: floral complex with a circumscribed palmette either side of the handles and a large and a small palmette addorsed under the handles; spiral terminals and dots.\r\nGround line: single reserved line. Graffiti under foot.\r\nRelief line contour throughout (double for hair); dilute glaze for minor interior markings; reserved line inside and outside lip; added red for inscriptions.","Producer name":"Attributed to: Douris","School\/style":null,"State":null,"Authority":null,"Ethnic name (made by)":null,"Ethnic name (assoc)":null,"Culture":"Attic","Production date":"485BC-480BC","Production place":"Made in: Attica (Greece)","Find spot":"Excavated\/Findspot: Vulci","Materials":"pottery","Ware":"Red Figure","Type series":null,"Technique":"painted","Dimensions":"Diameter: 12.70 centimetres of exterior ground line ; Diameter: 11.10 centimetres of foot plate ; Diameter: 20.30 centimetres of tondo ; Diameter: 30.20 centimetres; Height: 11.80 centimetres; Weight: 888 grammes; Width: 38.50 centimetres","Inscription":"Inscription type: inscription Inscription language: Greek Inscription script: Greek Inscription quoted: Interior: HOΠAIΣKALOΣ (retr.)\r\nExterior, upper: HOΠAIΣ KALOΣ\r\nExterior, lower: HOΠAIΣ KALOΣNAI+I; Inscription type: owner's mark Inscription position: under foot Inscription script: Etruscan Inscription note: Graffito with Etruscan alpha and two other letters, retrograde, plus a symbol.","Curators Comments":"CVA British Museum 9 \r\nBibliography: Mus.

Bloesch attributed the potting to Python - see further on Vase E51).\r\nThe presence of sponges and aryballoi place the scenes inside and out in the palaistra. The boy on the left of side A is adorned with a victor's trappings. The two bearded men who surround the boy on the right are probably courting him by attempting to exchange flowers (cf. Koch-Harnack 160-1). This theme appears to continue on side B, as is suggested by the movement of the himation by the boy on the right: compare the boy on the left of one side of a cup by Makron (ARV2 471, 196). This mixture of  palaistra and courting is to be found on a number of other cups by Douris. On two earlier cups (ARV2 430, 33; Wegner Duris figs. 14 and 16. ARV2 431, 38-42, associated by Wegner [Duris 135], Guy adding another Villa Giulia fragment) a boy victor also appears. On the later examples (ARV2 436, 99 with Beazley Add2 238; ARV2 437, 114; ARV2 437, 128, side B), and on one by a follower (ARV2 432, 60 with Beazley Add2 237, now attributed by J.R. Guy to his Painter of London Ε55) the attraction of a victor is omitted. If all the iconographic clues are taken literally, the occurrence of a victory ceremony of some sort within the palaistra may suggest that the competition was not associated with one of the Athenian festivals.\r\nFor attributes of victors (Olympic) see W.W. Hyde, Olympic Victor Monuments and Greek Athletic Art (Washington 1921) 148-61. A number of scenes on vases showing victors have been collected in T.B.L. Webster, Potter and Patron in Classical Athens (London 1972) 152-7: branches, tainiai and wreaths are common adornments (rarer are the special helmets on ARV2 446, 263 and 455, 10).\r\nEmpty net bags are sometimes seen hung up with sponge, aryballos and scraper (or being carried with them) on Dourian cups (ARV2 431, 40; 432, 60; 437, 114; 441, 187. Cf. also ARV2 326, 93 [Onesimos] and ARV2 348, 3 [Antiphontic]). They are probably being used to hold or carry equipment for the palaistra, see further on Vase E62.\r\nGraffito (a), a ligature of Μ and Z, is probably mercantile (Greek or Etruscan); (b) seems Etruscan and is perhaps part of a name.","Bib references":"Vase \/ Catalogue of Vases in the British Museum; CVA British Museum 9 \/ Corpus Vasorum Antiquorum: Great Britain 17, British Museum 9; Old

A bearded man stands to the left, but turns his head back to the right. Relief lines over brow and along neck contour; relief line curl under front of beard. His chest is shown frontal. He wears a himation which is draped over his left shoulder and a red apicate fillet in his hair. He holds a knotty stick in his right hand; his left arm, probably akimbo, is hidden in his himation. On the right a sponge, aryballos and, in front, a net bag with a tail hang from a red loop.\r\nBorder: alternating spiral maeander (twelve-stroke core; alternately clockwise and anticlockwise; additional unit at one o'clock) and blackened cross-square.\r\nEXTERIOR:  victor, youths, boys and men.\r\nSide A (upper): victor, youth, boy and two men. On the left a youth in a himation holds out a red circlet in his hands towards a boy. The youth has a red apicate fillet in his own hair (relief line strokes over brow and neck) and a plain stick rests loosely against his arm and chest. The naked boy facing him already has a long red fillet with loop and ties in his hair (relief lines over brow) and a second, longer and thicker one, a tainia, is tied round the biceps of his left arm and trails on the ground. In either hand he holds a red branch, perhaps of olive. In the centre stands a himation-clad man leaning to the right on a plain stick and holding out a small red flower in his right hand to a boy. The latter figure, also clad in himation holds out a small red flower too. Both figures have red apicate fillets in their hair (relief lines in hair as Ai). On the far right is a man in a himation leaning on a knotty stick. Under his left arm is tucked a pad of drapery that loops over his forearm, and his back is shown in three-quarter view. He holds a small red flower in his left hand and has a red apicate fillet in his hair (relief lines in hair as on Ai).\r\nSide Β (lower): three youths and two boys. On the left a youth in a himation stands to the left but with his head turned back to the right (front of head missing; relief lines in hair as interior). He has a red fillet in his hair and holds a knotty stick in his right hand. In front of him hang a sponge, an aryballos and a net bag. A boy, closely wrapped in a himation, faces him, a red apicate fillet in his hair (relief lines in hair as interior). In the centre stands a youth, his right leg and torso frontal, his head turned to the left. He wears a himation and a red apicate fillet in his hair (relief lines in hair as interior) and in his left hand holds a plain stick that crosses his body. He holds up his right hand with fingers spread. A boy moves towards him, but turns his head back to the right. A himation is draped over his left shoulder, but his right hand holds a bunch of folds so that most of his body is revealed. He has a red apicate fillet in his hair (relief lines in hair as interior). On the far right stands a youth in a himation and red apicate fillet, holding a plain stick in his right hand.\r\nAt either handle: floral complex with a circumscribed palmette either side of the handles and a large and a small palmette addorsed under the handles; spiral terminals and dots.\r\nGround line: single reserved line. Graffiti under foot.\r\nRelief line contour throughout (double for hair); dilute glaze for minor interior markings; reserved line inside and outside lip; added red for inscriptions.","Producer name":"Attributed to: Douris","School\/style":null,"State":null,"Authority":null,"Ethnic name (made by)":null,"Ethnic name (assoc)":null,"Culture":"Attic","Production date":"485BC-480BC","Production place":"Made in: Attica (Greece)","Find spot":"Excavated\/Findspot: Vulci","Materials":"pottery","Ware":"Red Figure","Type series":null,"Technique":"painted","Dimensions":"Diameter: 12.70 centimetres of exterior ground line ; Diameter: 11.10 centimetres of foot plate ; Diameter: 20.30 centimetres of tondo ; Diameter: 30.20 centimetres; Height: 11.80 centimetres; Weight: 888 grammes; Width: 38.50 centimetres","Inscription":"Inscription type: inscription Inscription language: Greek Inscription script: Greek Inscription quoted: Interior: HOΠAIΣKALOΣ (retr.)\r\nExterior, upper: HOΠAIΣ KALOΣ\r\nExterior, lower: HOΠAIΣ KALOΣNAI+I; Inscription type: owner's mark Inscription position: under foot Inscription script: Etruscan Inscription note: Graffito with Etruscan alpha and two other letters, retrograde, plus a symbol.","Curators Comments":"CVA British Museum 9 \r\nBibliography: Mus.

Bloesch attributed the potting to Python - see further on Vase E51).\r\nThe presence of sponges and aryballoi place the scenes inside and out in the palaistra. The boy on the left of side A is adorned with a victor's trappings. The two bearded men who surround the boy on the right are probably courting him by attempting to exchange flowers (cf. Koch-Harnack 160-1). This theme appears to continue on side B, as is suggested by the movement of the himation by the boy on the right: compare the boy on the left of one side of a cup by Makron (ARV2 471, 196). This mixture of  palaistra and courting is to be found on a number of other cups by Douris. On two earlier cups (ARV2 430, 33; Wegner Duris figs. 14 and 16. ARV2 431, 38-42, associated by Wegner [Duris 135], Guy adding another Villa Giulia fragment) a boy victor also appears. On the later examples (ARV2 436, 99 with Beazley Add2 238; ARV2 437, 114; ARV2 437, 128, side B), and on one by a follower (ARV2 432, 60 with Beazley Add2 237, now attributed by J.R. Guy to his Painter of London Ε55) the attraction of a victor is omitted. If all the iconographic clues are taken literally, the occurrence of a victory ceremony of some sort within the palaistra may suggest that the competition was not associated with one of the Athenian festivals.\r\nFor attributes of victors (Olympic) see W.W. Hyde, Olympic Victor Monuments and Greek Athletic Art (Washington 1921) 148-61. A number of scenes on vases showing victors have been collected in T.B.L. Webster, Potter and Patron in Classical Athens (London 1972) 152-7: branches, tainiai and wreaths are common adornments (rarer are the special helmets on ARV2 446, 263 and 455, 10).\r\nEmpty net bags are sometimes seen hung up with sponge, aryballos and scraper (or being carried with them) on Dourian cups (ARV2 431, 40; 432, 60; 437, 114; 441, 187. Cf. also ARV2 326, 93 [Onesimos] and ARV2 348, 3 [Antiphontic]). They are probably being used to hold or carry equipment for the palaistra, see further on Vase E62.\r\nGraffito (a), a ligature of Μ and Z, is probably mercantile (Greek or Etruscan); (b) seems Etruscan and is perhaps part of a name.","Bib references":"Vase \/ Catalogue of Vases in the British Museum; CVA British Museum 9 \/ Corpus Vasorum Antiquorum: Great Britain 17, British Museum 9; Old

A bearded man stands to the left, but turns his head back to the right. Relief lines over brow and along neck contour; relief line curl under front of beard. His chest is shown frontal. He wears a himation which is draped over his left shoulder and a red apicate fillet in his hair. He holds a knotty stick in his right hand; his left arm, probably akimbo, is hidden in his himation. On the right a sponge, aryballos and, in front, a net bag with a tail hang from a red loop.\r\nBorder: alternating spiral maeander (twelve-stroke core; alternately clockwise and anticlockwise; additional unit at one o'clock) and blackened cross-square.\r\nEXTERIOR:  victor, youths, boys and men.\r\nSide A (upper): victor, youth, boy and two men. On the left a youth in a himation holds out a red circlet in his hands towards a boy. The youth has a red apicate fillet in his own hair (relief line strokes over brow and neck) and a plain stick rests loosely against his arm and chest. The naked boy facing him already has a long red fillet with loop and ties in his hair (relief lines over brow) and a second, longer and thicker one, a tainia, is tied round the biceps of his left arm and trails on the ground. In either hand he holds a red branch, perhaps of olive. In the centre stands a himation-clad man leaning to the right on a plain stick and holding out a small red flower in his right hand to a boy. The latter figure, also clad in himation holds out a small red flower too. Both figures have red apicate fillets in their hair (relief lines in hair as Ai). On the far right is a man in a himation leaning on a knotty stick. Under his left arm is tucked a pad of drapery that loops over his forearm, and his back is shown in three-quarter view. He holds a small red flower in his left hand and has a red apicate fillet in his hair (relief lines in hair as on Ai).\r\nSide Β (lower): three youths and two boys. On the left a youth in a himation stands to the left but with his head turned back to the right (front of head missing; relief lines in hair as interior). He has a red fillet in his hair and holds a knotty stick in his right hand. In front of him hang a sponge, an aryballos and a net bag. A boy, closely wrapped in a himation, faces him, a red apicate fillet in his hair (relief lines in hair as interior). In the centre stands a youth, his right leg and torso frontal, his head turned to the left. He wears a himation and a red apicate fillet in his hair (relief lines in hair as interior) and in his left hand holds a plain stick that crosses his body. He holds up his right hand with fingers spread. A boy moves towards him, but turns his head back to the right. A himation is draped over his left shoulder, but his right hand holds a bunch of folds so that most of his body is revealed. He has a red apicate fillet in his hair (relief lines in hair as interior). On the far right stands a youth in a himation and red apicate fillet, holding a plain stick in his right hand.\r\nAt either handle: floral complex with a circumscribed palmette either side of the handles and a large and a small palmette addorsed under the handles; spiral terminals and dots.\r\nGround line: single reserved line. Graffiti under foot.\r\nRelief line contour throughout (double for hair); dilute glaze for minor interior markings; reserved line inside and outside lip; added red for inscriptions.","Producer name":"Attributed to: Douris","School\/style":null,"State":null,"Authority":null,"Ethnic name (made by)":null,"Ethnic name (assoc)":null,"Culture":"Attic","Production date":"485BC-480BC","Production place":"Made in: Attica (Greece)","Find spot":"Excavated\/Findspot: Vulci","Materials":"pottery","Ware":"Red Figure","Type series":null,"Technique":"painted","Dimensions":"Diameter: 12.70 centimetres of exterior ground line ; Diameter: 11.10 centimetres of foot plate ; Diameter: 20.30 centimetres of tondo ; Diameter: 30.20 centimetres; Height: 11.80 centimetres; Weight: 888 grammes; Width: 38.50 centimetres","Inscription":"Inscription type: inscription Inscription language: Greek Inscription script: Greek Inscription quoted: Interior: HOΠAIΣKALOΣ (retr.)\r\nExterior, upper: HOΠAIΣ KALOΣ\r\nExterior, lower: HOΠAIΣ KALOΣNAI+I; Inscription type: owner's mark Inscription position: under foot Inscription script: Etruscan Inscription note: Graffito with Etruscan alpha and two other letters, retrograde, plus a symbol.","Curators Comments":"CVA British Museum 9 \r\nBibliography: Mus.

Bloesch attributed the potting to Python - see further on Vase E51).\r\nThe presence of sponges and aryballoi place the scenes inside and out in the palaistra. The boy on the left of side A is adorned with a victor's trappings. The two bearded men who surround the boy on the right are probably courting him by attempting to exchange flowers (cf. Koch-Harnack 160-1). This theme appears to continue on side B, as is suggested by the movement of the himation by the boy on the right: compare the boy on the left of one side of a cup by Makron (ARV2 471, 196). This mixture of  palaistra and courting is to be found on a number of other cups by Douris. On two earlier cups (ARV2 430, 33; Wegner Duris figs. 14 and 16. ARV2 431, 38-42, associated by Wegner [Duris 135], Guy adding another Villa Giulia fragment) a boy victor also appears. On the later examples (ARV2 436, 99 with Beazley Add2 238; ARV2 437, 114; ARV2 437, 128, side B), and on one by a follower (ARV2 432, 60 with Beazley Add2 237, now attributed by J.R. Guy to his Painter of London Ε55) the attraction of a victor is omitted. If all the iconographic clues are taken literally, the occurrence of a victory ceremony of some sort within the palaistra may suggest that the competition was not associated with one of the Athenian festivals.\r\nFor attributes of victors (Olympic) see W.W. Hyde, Olympic Victor Monuments and Greek Athletic Art (Washington 1921) 148-61. A number of scenes on vases showing victors have been collected in T.B.L. Webster, Potter and Patron in Classical Athens (London 1972) 152-7: branches, tainiai and wreaths are common adornments (rarer are the special helmets on ARV2 446, 263 and 455, 10).\r\nEmpty net bags are sometimes seen hung up with sponge, aryballos and scraper (or being carried with them) on Dourian cups (ARV2 431, 40; 432, 60; 437, 114; 441, 187. Cf. also ARV2 326, 93 [Onesimos] and ARV2 348, 3 [Antiphontic]). They are probably being used to hold or carry equipment for the palaistra, see further on Vase E62.\r\nGraffito (a), a ligature of Μ and Z, is probably mercantile (Greek or Etruscan); (b) seems Etruscan and is perhaps part of a name.","Bib references":"Vase \/ Catalogue of Vases in the British Museum; CVA British Museum 9 \/ Corpus Vasorum Antiquorum: Great Britain 17, British Museum 9; Old

INTERIOR: symposiast. A youth reclines on a couch seen from the back. He is shown in back view with his raised right knee splaying to the right. He wears a himation (two line border) around his waist and legs and has a red fillet in his hair. He rests on his left elbow, with a bunch of drapery tucked under his arm and showing on the left. He holds out a small cup in his right hand: it is seen from underneath, the foot in his hand, the body black, the handles and rim reserved. On either side of the head of the couch projects the end of the cushion against which the youth leans. On the left is a three-legged table, underneath which is suspended a food basket (red tassels below). Above the youth hangs a cup, seen from underneath; on the left hangs a footed oinochoe. The couch rests on a large reserved exergue.\r\nBorder: alternating false maeander (ten-stroke, alternately clockwise and anticlockwise) and blackened cross-square (cross-square omitted at 3 o'clock).\r\nRelief line contour throughout (double for hair); added red for inscriptions.","Producer name":"Attributed to: Douris","School\/style":null,"State":null,"Authority":null,"Ethnic name (made by)":null,"Ethnic name (assoc)":null,"Culture":"Attic","Production date":"490BC-480BC","Production place":"Made in: Attica (Greece)","Find spot":"Excavated\/Findspot: Falerii","Materials":"pottery","Ware":"Red Figure","Type series":null,"Technique":"painted","Dimensions":"Diameter: 8 centimetres of foot plate ; Diameter: 14.40 centimetres of tondo ; Diameter: 19.70 centimetres; Height: 9 centimetres restored","Inscription":"Inscription type: inscription Inscription position: Interior Inscription language: Greek Inscription script: Greek Inscription quoted: KALΟΣ ΗΙΠΟΛAMAΣ Inscription note: The normal delta, with dot for lower stroke, used by Douris","Curators Comments":"CVA British Museum 9\r\nBibliography: Hartwig Μ 608-10 and 686 no. 41, pl. 67, 4; Hoppin i 282 no. 69; AV 205, 44; ARV 291, 174; Bloesch FAS 100, no. 37; ARV2 443, 227 and p. 1653; Wegner Duris 83-4; Para 375; Beazley Add2 240; Buitron-Oliver Douris no. 102.\r\nAttributed by Hartwig to Douris; placed by Beazley in that artist's middle period (period 3, Hippodaman) and by Buitron-Oliver in her Middle I. Potting attributed by Bloesch to Python. The foot is certainly a Python foot, but it is possible that it does not belong.\r\nFor early discussions of the rear view of the couch see Beazley in Studies Robinson ii 75 with note. It is seen on two other cups by Douris (Vase Ε49; and Florence 3922, ARV2 432, 55). It is also found on some Brygan cups (e.g. ARV2 372, 38; 402, 12). A rear view of a couch is seen on an earlier cup by Epiktetos in the British Museum (Vase E38: ARV2 72, 16; M. Robertson, MüJb 27 [1976] 37 fig. 10 with p 40-1) and on one of the fragments of a very early calyx-krater by the Kleophrades Painter (Copenhagen 13365 fragments: ARV2 185, 32; CVA Copenhagen p. 259, fig., the missing fragment). There are still earlier fragments in the collection of Dr. H.A. Cahn that also preserve a couch seen in rear view (Basel, Cahn 680 fragments; Attische Meisterzeichnungen: Vasenfragmente der Sammlung Herbert A. Cahn, Basel [Freiburg, Oct. 1988-March 1989] 8 no. 25; see further D. Williams New Perspectives 292 with fig. 8 [one fragment only]). It is possible that the idea was developed by a Pioneer like Euphronios.\r\nA second cup decorated inside only with the figure of a symposiast (not end-on) is to be found in a Centre Island private collection (attributed by D. von Bothmer).\r\nThe drawing of the cup that the symposiast holds out is particularly unusual. Cups with black bodies and reserved lips are occasionally seen in the works of other artists (e.g. AKV2 339, 57, Antiphon Painter). For cups seen from underneath, see Vase E49.\r\nOn Hippodamas see ARV2 1585 and Beazley Add2 395-6: he is praised on cups by both Douris and Makron and is usually presumed to be the strategos of 459\/8 BC.","Bib references":"Vase \/ Catalogue of Vases in the British Museum; CVA British Museum 9 \/ Corpus Vasorum Antiquorum: Great Britain 17, British Museum 9","Location":"On display (G20a\/dc2)","Exhibition history":null,"Condition":"Made up from fragments; stem modern, foot may belong; left handle missing, together with two rim fragments; surface weathered.","Subjects":"symposium","Assoc name":null,"Assoc place":null,"Assoc events":null,"Assoc titles":null,"Acq name (acq)":"Purchased from: Dr Paul Hartwig","Acq name (finding)":null,"Acq name (excavator)":null,"Acq name (previous)":null,"Acq date":"1892","Acq notes (acq)":null,"Acq notes (exc)":null,"Dept":"Greek and Roman","BM\/Big number":null,"Reg number":"1892,0518.1","Add ids":null,"Cat no":null,"Banknote serial number":null,"Joined objects":null,"BM_Object_URL":"https:\/\/www.britishmuseum.org\/collection\/object\/G_1892-0518-1","BM_URL_Status":403,"BM_URL_Method":"GET","BM_URL_Note":"not-found-or-forbidden","image_url":"http:\/\/media.britishmuseum.org\/media\/Repository\/Documents\/2014_10\/4_13\/91d5abcd_5ab0_4fdc_8663_a3ba00dd7368\/max_00232149_001.jpg","image_local_path":"C:\\Users\\Katya\\mag_vase\\bm_images_max\\No__1892_0518.1_01.jpg","image":"\/data\/local-files\/?d=bm_images_max\/No__1892_0518.1_01.jpg","Approx_BC_year":485.0,"Period_bin":"520–480 BC","annotation_id":null,"annotator":null,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null,"lead_time":null,"label":null},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-11-26T13:39:10.305426Z","updated_at":"2025-11-27T09:43:22.979610Z","inner_id":584,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":17,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":6745,"annotations":[{"id":447,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"original_width":1876,"original_height":2500,"image_rotation":0,"value":{"x":69.83679348981538,"y":35.069106921557925,"width":8.581080485516082,"height":7.033634439069523,"rotation":0,"rectanglelabels":["cuttle-fish"]},"id":"6yYYnTDGiW","from_name":"label","to_name":"image","type":"rectanglelabels","origin":"manual"},{"original_width":1876,"original_height":2500,"image_rotation":0,"value":{"x":70.760909849794,"y":51.71207291822939,"width":9.76923009120278,"height":13.175681414031622,"rotation":0,"rectanglelabels":["woman"]},"id":"8VDuq1V6II","from_name":"label","to_name":"image","type":"rectanglelabels","origin":"manual"},{"original_width":1876,"original_height":2500,"image_rotation":0,"value":{"x":55.31496497586511,"y":34.97004164776821,"width":6.732847765558773,"height":6.340177522541545,"rotation":0,"rectanglelabels":["wreath"]},"id":"8wCpqQRCYY","from_name":"label","to_name":"image","type":"rectanglelabels","origin":"manual"},{"original_width":1876,"original_height":2500,"image_rotation":0,"value":{"x":26.799374439380948,"y":64.09523214194344,"width":51.750516158804594,"height":6.241112248751833,"rotation":0,"rectanglelabels":["wave"]},"id":"9MJssjbxlL","from_name":"label","to_name":"image","type":"rectanglelabels","origin":"manual"},{"original_width":1876,"original_height":2500,"image_rotation":0,"value":{"x":23.410937590042067,"y":35.13513513513514,"width":54.2825036428448,"height":28.764478764478767,"rotation":0,"rectanglelabels":["Scylla"]},"id":"pAHbR3rOsw","from_name":"label","to_name":"image","type":"rectanglelabels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-11-27T10:40:50.162771Z","updated_at":"2025-11-27T10:41:30.237841Z","draft_created_at":"2025-11-27T10:39:29.922289Z","lead_time":336.62399999999997,"prediction":{},"result_count":5,"unique_id":"4585c2af-65ab-4df2-9b6e-9e111392eef7","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"bulk_created":false,"task":6745,"project":17,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"efc6e154-project-6-stratified-full.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"Image":"https:\/\/media.britishmuseum.org\/media\/Repository\/Documents\/2014_10\/1_11\/5f8626b4_be67_49c8_932c_a3b700bdf342\/preview_00054376_001.jpg","Object type":"hydria","Museum number":"No: 1836,0224.67","Title":null,"Denomination":null,"Escapement":null,"Description":"Red figured pottery hydria.\r\nDesign red on black ground, with accessories of white and yellow.

He turns away from her, extending both arms eagerly towards Athene, who, as the Athenian κονροτρόφος, moves forward to receive him into a striped mantle which she holds out in both her hands; she wears a long chiton with a border of ivy-leaves (?) and apoptygma, a mantle rolled up over her shoulders, aegis covered with a scaly pattern, a high crested helmet with crown of scales and high raised cheek-pieces, and bracelets; her hair hangs down in a knot, and her long spear rests against her left shoulder. The crest of her helmet is partly cut off by the border; her spear passes over it. She is accompanied on the right by Nike, who rushes forward, holding out in both hands a large taenia towards the infant; she wears a long chiton, a diploïs spotted, with a fringe below, a mantle over her arms, a radiated stephane, bracelets, and trefoil earrings; her hair hangs down in a club. On the left of Gaia Zeus stands en face, looking down at her with his right on his hip and his left holding up a thunderbolt. He is bearded, and has long hair passed in a plait round the back of his head, a wreath, and a mantle with patterns of triple lines and circles like that which Athene holds. On the left Oinanthè stands, in a long chiton undertied, her hair knotted behind with a fillet, and right hand on hip, leaning with her left hand on Zeus' shoulder, and looking over it at the infant. Above her is inscribed ΟΙΝΑΝΘΕ KAΛE, Οίνάνθη καλή.\r\nLater and florid stage of large style. Purple ends of taenia, inscription, and fillet of Oinanthè. Brown inner markings, folds of chiton of Gaia, and hair of Dionysos. Eye in transition type. The hands very large and clumsily drawn. The design curves up over the shoulder. Below, a strip of sets of maeander alternate ways divided by red cross squares. Above, a strip of ivy wreath. Round the lip, egg pattern.","Producer name":"Attributed to: The Oinanthe Painter","School\/style":null,"State":null,"Authority":null,"Ethnic name (made by)":null,"Ethnic name (assoc)":null,"Culture":"Attic","Production date":"470BC-460BC","Production place":"Made in: Attica (Greece)","Find spot":"Excavated\/Findspot: Chiusi","Materials":"pottery","Ware":"Red Figure","Type series":null,"Technique":"painted","Dimensions":"Height: 37.50 centimetres; Length: 35 centimetres; Depth: 27.50 centimetres","Inscription":"Inscription type: inscription","Curators Comments":"BM Cat.

This figure, the presence of Zeus, and the absence of Kekrops, have suggested the birth of Dionysos as the subject. Robert loc. cit. proposes to identify Gaia as Dirke (cf. ibid. pl. iii).

In the centre Triptolemos, a wreathed youth in a mantle, holding a sceptre with lotus top upright in his left, is seated to right in the winged chariot, his feet resting on a foot-board which is decorated with egg pattern. In his right he holds out a fluted phiale to be filled by Demeter, who with sceptre (like that of Triptolemos) held upright against her left arm pours wine into it from an oinochoe, so that it overflows: she wears a long bordered chiton with apoptygma tied, and earrings, and her long hair is confined with a radiated stephane decorated with egg pattern. On the right (within the handle of the vase) Hecate stands en face, but looking to left, holding out on each side of her a blazing torch: she wears a Doric chiton with apoptygma, and has her hair knotted with a radiated fillet. Above each of these figures is inscribed their name, TPIPTOΛEMOΣ, Tριπτόλεμος, ΔΗΜΗΤΗΡ, Δημήτηρ, ΕΚΑΤΗ, 'Εκάτη. On the right a woman runs up, with sleeved chiton, mantle and radiated sphendone, holding in her right a tripod situla filled with fruits (?). On the left of Triptolemos Persephone stands en face, with sceptre and dress like those of Demeter, but hair looped up, and earrings: she turns to left, extending her right hand towards a woman advancing on left with two torches, a long sleeved chiton and mantle, and headdress like that of Hecate: her body is drawn within the handle. On the left stands Pluto with white hair and beard, a long chiton and mantle: he carries on his right arm a sceptre (as before), on his left a large cornucopia filled with fruits. On the bottom of the foot, incised characters, ΛΗ.\r\nLarge style, but drawing careless. Purple (now nearly white) for hair of Pluto, flames, headdresses, inscriptions, wine, and stem and flowers of the myrtle wreaths which encircle the head of Triptolemos and neck of the vase. Brown markings of wings and fruit. Eye in profile. The design curves up over the shoulder. Below, a continuous band, sets of six maeanders separated by dotted chequer squares. Round the lip, egg pattern. Below the back handle, a double palmette with tendrils; around the insertion of each handle, tongue pattern.","Producer name":"Attributed to: The Painter of London E183","School\/style":null,"State":null,"Authority":null,"Ethnic name (made by)":null,"Ethnic name (assoc)":null,"Culture":"Attic","Production date":"430BC (circa)","Production place":"Made in: Attica (Greece)","Find spot":"Excavated\/Findspot: Nola","Materials":"pottery","Ware":"Red Figure","Type series":null,"Technique":"painted","Dimensions":"Height: 43.18 centimetres","Inscription":"Inscription type: inscription Inscription position: in field Inscription language: Greek Inscription script: Greek Inscription quoted: see description Inscription note: Figures labelled.; Inscription type: merchant's mark Inscription position: under foot Inscription script: Greek Inscription note: Graffito  ΛH","Curators Comments":"BM Cat.

In the centre Triptolemos, a wreathed youth in a mantle, holding a sceptre with lotus top upright in his left, is seated to right in the winged chariot, his feet resting on a foot-board which is decorated with egg pattern. In his right he holds out a fluted phiale to be filled by Demeter, who with sceptre (like that of Triptolemos) held upright against her left arm pours wine into it from an oinochoe, so that it overflows: she wears a long bordered chiton with apoptygma tied, and earrings, and her long hair is confined with a radiated stephane decorated with egg pattern. On the right (within the handle of the vase) Hecate stands en face, but looking to left, holding out on each side of her a blazing torch: she wears a Doric chiton with apoptygma, and has her hair knotted with a radiated fillet. Above each of these figures is inscribed their name, TPIPTOΛEMOΣ, Tριπτόλεμος, ΔΗΜΗΤΗΡ, Δημήτηρ, ΕΚΑΤΗ, 'Εκάτη. On the right a woman runs up, with sleeved chiton, mantle and radiated sphendone, holding in her right a tripod situla filled with fruits (?). On the left of Triptolemos Persephone stands en face, with sceptre and dress like those of Demeter, but hair looped up, and earrings: she turns to left, extending her right hand towards a woman advancing on left with two torches, a long sleeved chiton and mantle, and headdress like that of Hecate: her body is drawn within the handle. On the left stands Pluto with white hair and beard, a long chiton and mantle: he carries on his right arm a sceptre (as before), on his left a large cornucopia filled with fruits. On the bottom of the foot, incised characters, ΛΗ.\r\nLarge style, but drawing careless. Purple (now nearly white) for hair of Pluto, flames, headdresses, inscriptions, wine, and stem and flowers of the myrtle wreaths which encircle the head of Triptolemos and neck of the vase. Brown markings of wings and fruit. Eye in profile. The design curves up over the shoulder. Below, a continuous band, sets of six maeanders separated by dotted chequer squares. Round the lip, egg pattern. Below the back handle, a double palmette with tendrils; around the insertion of each handle, tongue pattern.","Producer name":"Attributed to: The Painter of London E183","School\/style":null,"State":null,"Authority":null,"Ethnic name (made by)":null,"Ethnic name (assoc)":null,"Culture":"Attic","Production date":"430BC (circa)","Production place":"Made in: Attica (Greece)","Find spot":"Excavated\/Findspot: Nola","Materials":"pottery","Ware":"Red Figure","Type series":null,"Technique":"painted","Dimensions":"Height: 43.18 centimetres","Inscription":"Inscription type: inscription Inscription position: in field Inscription language: Greek Inscription script: Greek Inscription quoted: see description Inscription note: Figures labelled.; Inscription type: merchant's mark Inscription position: under foot Inscription script: Greek Inscription note: Graffito  ΛH","Curators Comments":"BM Cat.

In the centre Triptolemos, a wreathed youth in a mantle, holding a sceptre with lotus top upright in his left, is seated to right in the winged chariot, his feet resting on a foot-board which is decorated with egg pattern. In his right he holds out a fluted phiale to be filled by Demeter, who with sceptre (like that of Triptolemos) held upright against her left arm pours wine into it from an oinochoe, so that it overflows: she wears a long bordered chiton with apoptygma tied, and earrings, and her long hair is confined with a radiated stephane decorated with egg pattern. On the right (within the handle of the vase) Hecate stands en face, but looking to left, holding out on each side of her a blazing torch: she wears a Doric chiton with apoptygma, and has her hair knotted with a radiated fillet. Above each of these figures is inscribed their name, TPIPTOΛEMOΣ, Tριπτόλεμος, ΔΗΜΗΤΗΡ, Δημήτηρ, ΕΚΑΤΗ, 'Εκάτη. On the right a woman runs up, with sleeved chiton, mantle and radiated sphendone, holding in her right a tripod situla filled with fruits (?). On the left of Triptolemos Persephone stands en face, with sceptre and dress like those of Demeter, but hair looped up, and earrings: she turns to left, extending her right hand towards a woman advancing on left with two torches, a long sleeved chiton and mantle, and headdress like that of Hecate: her body is drawn within the handle. On the left stands Pluto with white hair and beard, a long chiton and mantle: he carries on his right arm a sceptre (as before), on his left a large cornucopia filled with fruits. On the bottom of the foot, incised characters, ΛΗ.\r\nLarge style, but drawing careless. Purple (now nearly white) for hair of Pluto, flames, headdresses, inscriptions, wine, and stem and flowers of the myrtle wreaths which encircle the head of Triptolemos and neck of the vase. Brown markings of wings and fruit. Eye in profile. The design curves up over the shoulder. Below, a continuous band, sets of six maeanders separated by dotted chequer squares. Round the lip, egg pattern. Below the back handle, a double palmette with tendrils; around the insertion of each handle, tongue pattern.","Producer name":"Attributed to: The Painter of London E183","School\/style":null,"State":null,"Authority":null,"Ethnic name (made by)":null,"Ethnic name (assoc)":null,"Culture":"Attic","Production date":"430BC (circa)","Production place":"Made in: Attica (Greece)","Find spot":"Excavated\/Findspot: Nola","Materials":"pottery","Ware":"Red Figure","Type series":null,"Technique":"painted","Dimensions":"Height: 43.18 centimetres","Inscription":"Inscription type: inscription Inscription position: in field Inscription language: Greek Inscription script: Greek Inscription quoted: see description Inscription note: Figures labelled.; Inscription type: merchant's mark Inscription position: under foot Inscription script: Greek Inscription note: Graffito  ΛH","Curators Comments":"BM Cat.

Medusa's head. In the centre Medusa, a winged, headless figure in a short tied bordered chiton with sleeves, has fallen to the left, but supports herself on her rigid arms, resting only on the finger-tips, the blood flowing in a broad stream from the wound. On the left, Perseus flees to left, both arms extended in front of him, and looking round at Medusa; he wears a chiton like that of Medusa, the winged hat (κυνή Αίδον) and talaria; at his side there hangs from his left shoulder the wallet (kibisis), in which the upper part of the Gorgoneion is visible, en face (with closed eyes, black hair around the forehead, and outside this a broad strip forming a sort of frame, shaded brownish); in his left hand is the harpe, sickle-shaped, the edge jagged, the handle ending in a spiral; his long hair is looped up over his ears. On the right of Medusa, Athene runs to the left, carrying a very long spear over her right shoulder, and with her left hand raising the edge of her skirt; she wears a long undertied sleeved chiton, which has no folds, but a pattern of Vs, dotted aegis fringed with snakes, and a tall crested helmet; her long hair floats back, the ends drawn in thinned black.\r\nAdvanced stage of severe style. Purple blood. Brown inner markings, upper folds of Medusa's chiton, and pinion feathers of her wings; on the upper part of Perseus' chiton no folds are visible. Eye in transition type (disc close to inner angle, which is opened). The design is principally on the shoulder, and comes very little below the level of the side handles; below it, a strip of sets of three maeanders separated by red cross squares. Round the lip, egg pattern.","Producer name":"Attributed to: The Pan Painter","School\/style":null,"State":null,"Authority":null,"Ethnic name (made by)":null,"Ethnic name

type":"kylix","Museum number":"No: 1843,1103.11","Title":null,"Denomination":null,"Escapement":null,"Description":"Pottery: red-figured kylix. Description\r\nINTERIOR: man leading a woman (Odysseus and Briseis?). On the left a young woman, head lowered, is being led to the right. She wears a chiton and a himation (horizontal battlement border, dilute glaze vertical band, rows of dilute glaze dots) which is pulled up over the back of her head. She has a disc earring and a stephane with a row of sigmas. Her hair has a wash of dilute glaze and one long curly tress falls down behind her ear. Her mouth is slightly open and she must be exchanging words with the bearded man on the right, who similarly has his mouth open. Dressed in short chiton (dilute glaze folds), himation (rows of dots; battlement upper border) and petasos with red ties, he moves to the right, but turns his head back to look at the girl whom he leads, gripping her left wrist and hand in his right. He holds a spear in his left hand across his body, so that the point is above her head. There is dilute shading on his petasos at the top and above the beginning of the brim. His hair and beard are done with a dilute glaze wash and there are rows of dilute glaze dots on his neck. Border: stopt maeander (five-stroke, anticlockwise).\r\nEXTERIOR:  the Arms of Achilles. \r\nSide A (upper): quarrel over the arms of Achilles. On the far left a male in dotted chlamys holds the right arm of the figure in front of him (his head and part of his draped lower torso are missing). In front is a bearded man, probably Ajax, in boots (dilute glaze wash) with horizontal rolls and red ties and a dotted himation with a black border loosely draped over his arms, who attempts to move forward to the right. He holds a sword back in his right hand and a striped scabbard in his left. His pectorals and mid-line are enhanced with dilute glaze to indicate hair. A youth tries to push him back to the left. He has a chlamys with rows of dots in dilute glaze over his upper arms and turns his head back to the right. His hair is painted with dilute glaze. In the centre is a man in a long chiton (folds in dilute glaze) and a dotted himation with a battlement upper border; he is presumably Agamemnon. He moves to the left, but his arms are outstretched to left and right; his head, which is missing, was turned to the right, as the red ties from his headband on the left indicate. On the right a youth pushes to the right at a bearded man. The youth has a himation (black border, rows of dots) loosely draped over his shoulders; his hair is combed up in plait over his neck and he has a double red hair-band. The bearded man, probably Odysseus, in front of him endeavours to move to the left. In the struggle his himation (black border, rows of dots) has slipped from his right shoulder; he has just drawn his sword from its striped scabbard, which he holds in his left hand (hand and top of scabbard missing). He wears boots like those worn by Ajax: rolls above the ankles, red ties and dilute wash. His pectorals and mid-line are enhanced with dilute glaze to indicate hair and his lips are slightly parted. On the far right a bearded man moves to the left, a dotted himation (black border) over his shoulders, his right hand gripping the left shoulder of the man in front, his left hand probably the man's left wrist (both missing). His hair is combed up into a stiff fringe and his pectorals and mid-line are enhanced with dilute glaze to indicate hair.\r\nSide Β (lower): the vote for the arms of Achilles. On the far left stands Odysseus, dressed in a dotted himation with a battlement border (all the himatia on this side have such a border) and shoes. He leans on a knotty stick, his right hand on his hip under the drapery, his left hand up in front of his chest. His pectorals and mid-line are enhanced with dilute glaze to indicate hair. His mouth is open and he has a red apicate fillet. In front of him stands a youth, dressed in a himation with rows of dots and leaning on a knotty stick. He reaches down to the right with his right hand to place his pebble (not shown) on the plain block (dilute wash) in the centre. His hair is tied up in a plait over his neck and he has a double red fillet. His left hand is to be thought of as on top of his stick, near his right armpit. In front of him stands Athena who wears a chiton, himation, scaly snake-fringed aegis (dilute wash inside) and Attic helmet (dilute wash for caul; black neck-guard). She holds a spear upright in her right hand and gestures with her left hand. Her head (hair done with dilute wash) is turned to the right, but her right knee is bent and the leg is to be thought of as facing to the left. Her lower legs are obscured by the corner of the block. On the corner in front of the folds of her chiton are two rows of black pebbles, totalling twenty. In the centre stands a bearded man to the left, wearing a dotted himation and a red fillet. He twists his right shoulder in order to place a pebble (not shown) on the block which hides his lower legs. His left hand is on a knotty stick, which goes under his left armpit (lower part of stick not drawn). At the right corner of the block stands a youth in a himation with rows of dots and double red hair-band leaning back on a knotty stick. He also holds his right hand down to cast his vote. On the corner of the block in front of the folds of his himation are two rows of black pebbles, totalling eleven. On the right a bearded man in a dotted himation and shoes moves forward to the left to vote, but turns his head back to the right. He holds a knotty stick in his left hand across his body and holds his right hand out to vote (pebble not shown). He has a reserved head-band. On the far right stands Ajax, his dotted himation with its battlement border framing his head. He leans on a knotty stick (with groups of horizontal lines in dilute glaze on it), his head lowered in despair, his right hand to his forehead. He wears a red fillet.\r\nUnder handles: B\/A, Corinthian helmet (dilute glaze on cheek-piece; black on neck-piece; dilute glaze wash for fur frontiet; chequer-board pattern on caul) on top of a shield (dilute glaze hatching before rim); A\/B, pair of greaves (dilute glaze wash, elaborate modelling around knee-caps and a scroll on the calf, red ties above). Ground line: two reserved lines.\r\nRelief line contour throughout (except hair); dilute glaze for minor interior markings; thick reserved line inside lip, thin outside.","Producer name":"Attributed to: The Brygos Painter","School\/style":null,"State":null,"Authority":null,"Ethnic name (made by)":null,"Ethnic name (assoc)":null,"Culture":"Attic","Production date":"490BC-480BC","Production place":"Made in: Attica (Greece)","Find spot":"Excavated\/Findspot: Vulci","Materials":"pottery","Ware":"Red Figure","Type series":null,"Technique":"painted","Dimensions":"Diameter: 32.70 centimetres; Height: 13.80 millimetres; Weight: 1.05 kilograms; Width: 41.50 centimetres","Inscription":null,"Curators Comments":"CVA British Museum 9\r\nBibliography: Mus.

Beazley gave it to his Brygos Painter. It is an early mature work of the artist and may be compared with the Louvre Troilos cup and the Vatican arming cup (ARV2 369, 3; 373, 48). These seem to be slightly later than Vase E68 and they lead on to fully mature works such as the Vienna skyphos (ARV2 380, 171). There is both vitality and power in the drawing and a fine range of moods in the narrative. Bloesch has attributed the potting to Brygos.\r\nThe quarrel between Ajax and Odysseus for the arms of Achilles has been discussed recently by O. Touchefeu in LIMC i sv Aias I  p. 324-7; D. Williams, AntK 23 (1980) 137-45; Schefold Sagen 259-61. See also H.A. Shapiro, BABesch 56 (1981) 149-50; G.F. Pinney and R. Hamilton, AJA 86 (1982) 581-4; and M. Tiverios, Mia \"Krisis ton Oplon\" tou zographou tou Sulea (Athens 1985); but contrast D. Williams in F. Lissarrague and F. Thelamon (eds.), Image et céramique grecque (Rouen 1983) 139 f.n. 60. For a possible early representation of the quarrel see A.-N. Malagardis in Ancient Greek and Related Pottery, Copenhagen 390-406. See also now Beazley in Beazley Lectures 91-2 and Robertson Art of Vase-painting 87-9.\r\nVarious suggestions have been offered as to the identity of the two figures on the interior: see ARV2 369, 2; Robertson HGA 232; D. Williams, AntK 23 (1980) 140; Schefold Sagen 261; Robertson Art of Vasepainting 95-6. The petasos worn by the man recommends an identification as Odysseus; the girl might be Chryseis, as D.S. Robertson suggested following Iliad i 439-45 (quoted in ARV2 369, 2), but this would remove any close connection with the scenes on the exterior. Martin Robertson (HGA 232) suggested Tekmessa with either Teukros leading her away after the death of Ajax or Ajax himself with his newly won concubine. Schefold, however, has recently suggested Briseis, an additional prize that went to Odysseus with Achilles' arms. The pair seem to be conversing and the angle of the spear recalls that held by Patroklos on the Getty Iliupersis cup by Onesimos (D. Williams, Getty Vases 5 [1991] 58): it surely symbolises possession. As a result, Schefold's solution is perhaps the best. A very similar pair, only the man lacks the petasos, occurs on a fine cup by the Foundry Painter in Tarquinia (ARV2 405, 1), which Beazley identified as Agamemnon and Briseis.\r\nFor the chequer board pattern on the caul of the helmet cf. the Vienna skyphos (ARV2 380, 171) and see Beazley in C.B. iii, 36, where he suggests that on such helmets a patterned fabric might have been attached to the metal, although it now seems more likely that the bronze was actually painted (cf. H. Bron in M. True and J. Podany [eds.], Small Bronze Sculpture from the Ancient World [Malibu 1990] 189-94). The horizontal bands on the boots worn by Ajax and Odysseus on side A are probably caused by tying additional thongs around the soft boots to try to stop them sliding down: cf. Morrow Greek Footwear 65: she notes the same effect on the Parthenon Frieze, North XXXIX 122 (her pl. 45).","Bib references":"Vase \/ Catalogue of Vases in the British Museum; CVA British Museum 9 \/

Description\r\nINTERIOR: man leading a woman (Odysseus and Briseis?). On the left a young woman, head lowered, is being led to the right. She wears a chiton and a himation (horizontal battlement border, dilute glaze vertical band, rows of dilute glaze dots) which is pulled up over the back of her head. She has a disc earring and a stephane with a row of sigmas. Her hair has a wash of dilute glaze and one long curly tress falls down behind her ear. Her mouth is slightly open and she must be exchanging words with the bearded man on the right, who similarly has his mouth open. Dressed in short chiton (dilute glaze folds), himation (rows of dots; battlement upper border) and petasos with red ties, he moves to the right, but turns his head back to look at the girl whom he leads, gripping her left wrist and hand in his right. He holds a spear in his left hand across his body, so that the point is above her head. There is dilute shading on his petasos at the top and above the beginning of the brim. His hair and beard are done with a dilute glaze wash and there are rows of dilute glaze dots on his neck. Border: stopt maeander (five-stroke, anticlockwise).\r\nEXTERIOR:  the Arms of Achilles. \r\nSide A (upper): quarrel over the arms of Achilles. On the far left a male in dotted chlamys holds the right arm of the figure in front of him (his head and part of his draped lower torso are missing). In front is a bearded man, probably Ajax, in boots (dilute glaze wash) with horizontal rolls and red ties and a dotted himation with a black border loosely draped over his arms, who attempts to move forward to the right. He holds a sword back in his right hand and a striped scabbard in his left. His pectorals and mid-line are enhanced with dilute glaze to indicate hair. A youth tries to push him back to the left. He has a chlamys with rows of dots in dilute glaze over his upper arms and turns his head back to the right. His hair is painted with dilute glaze. In the centre is a man in a long chiton (folds in dilute glaze) and a dotted himation with a battlement upper border; he is presumably Agamemnon. He moves to the left, but his arms are outstretched to left and right; his head, which is missing, was turned to the right, as the red ties from his headband on the left indicate. On the right a youth pushes to the right at a bearded man. The youth has a himation (black border, rows of dots) loosely draped over his shoulders; his hair is combed up in plait over his neck and he has a double red hair-band. The bearded man, probably Odysseus, in front of him endeavours to move to the left. In the struggle his himation (black border, rows of dots) has slipped from his right shoulder; he has just drawn his sword from its striped scabbard, which he holds in his left hand (hand and top of scabbard missing). He wears boots like those worn by Ajax: rolls above the ankles, red ties and dilute wash. His pectorals and mid-line are enhanced with dilute glaze to indicate hair and his lips are slightly parted. On the far right a bearded man moves to the left, a dotted himation (black border) over his shoulders, his right hand gripping the left shoulder of the man in front, his left hand probably the man's left wrist (both missing). His hair is combed up into a stiff fringe and his pectorals and mid-line are enhanced with dilute glaze to indicate hair.\r\nSide Β (lower): the vote for the arms of Achilles. On the far left stands Odysseus, dressed in a dotted himation with a battlement border (all the himatia on this side have such a border) and shoes. He leans on a knotty stick, his right hand on his hip under the drapery, his left hand up in front of his chest. His pectorals and mid-line are enhanced with dilute glaze to indicate hair. His mouth is open and he has a red apicate fillet. In front of him stands a youth, dressed in a himation with rows of dots and leaning on a knotty stick. He reaches down to the right with his right hand to place his pebble (not shown) on the plain block (dilute wash) in the centre. His hair is tied up in a plait over his neck and he has a double red fillet. His left hand is to be thought of as on top of his stick, near his right armpit. In front of him stands Athena who wears a chiton, himation, scaly snake-fringed aegis (dilute wash inside) and Attic helmet (dilute wash for caul; black neck-guard). She holds a spear upright in her right hand and gestures with her left hand. Her head (hair done with dilute wash) is turned to the right, but her right knee is bent and the leg is to be thought of as facing to the left. Her lower legs are obscured by the corner of the block. On the corner in front of the folds of her chiton are two rows of black pebbles, totalling twenty. In the centre stands a bearded man to the left, wearing a dotted himation and a red fillet. He twists his right shoulder in order to place a pebble (not shown) on the block which hides his lower legs. His left hand is on a knotty stick, which goes under his left armpit (lower part of stick not drawn). At the right corner of the block stands a youth in a himation with rows of dots and double red hair-band leaning back on a knotty stick. He also holds his right hand down to cast his vote. On the corner of the block in front of the folds of his himation are two rows of black pebbles, totalling eleven. On the right a bearded man in a dotted himation and shoes moves forward to the left to vote, but turns his head back to the right. He holds a knotty stick in his left hand across his body and holds his right hand out to vote (pebble not shown). He has a reserved head-band. On the far right stands Ajax, his dotted himation with its battlement border framing his head. He leans on a knotty stick (with groups of horizontal lines in dilute glaze on it), his head lowered in despair, his right hand to his forehead. He wears a red fillet.\r\nUnder handles: B\/A, Corinthian helmet (dilute glaze on cheek-piece; black on neck-piece; dilute glaze wash for fur frontiet; chequer-board pattern on caul) on top of a shield (dilute glaze hatching before rim); A\/B, pair of greaves (dilute glaze wash, elaborate modelling around knee-caps and a scroll on the calf, red ties above). Ground line: two reserved lines.\r\nRelief line contour throughout (except hair); dilute glaze for minor interior markings; thick reserved line inside lip, thin outside.","Producer name":"Attributed to: The Brygos Painter","School\/style":null,"State":null,"Authority":null,"Ethnic name (made by)":null,"Ethnic name (assoc)":null,"Culture":"Attic","Production date":"490BC-480BC","Production place":"Made in: Attica (Greece)","Find spot":"Excavated\/Findspot: Vulci","Materials":"pottery","Ware":"Red Figure","Type series":null,"Technique":"painted","Dimensions":"Diameter: 32.70 centimetres; Height: 13.80 millimetres; Weight: 1.05 kilograms; Width: 41.50 centimetres","Inscription":null,"Curators Comments":"CVA British Museum 9\r\nBibliography: Mus.

Beazley gave it to his Brygos Painter. It is an early mature work of the artist and may be compared with the Louvre Troilos cup and the Vatican arming cup (ARV2 369, 3; 373, 48). These seem to be slightly later than Vase E68 and they lead on to fully mature works such as the Vienna skyphos (ARV2 380, 171). There is both vitality and power in the drawing and a fine range of moods in the narrative. Bloesch has attributed the potting to Brygos.\r\nThe quarrel between Ajax and Odysseus for the arms of Achilles has been discussed recently by O. Touchefeu in LIMC i sv Aias I  p. 324-7; D. Williams, AntK 23 (1980) 137-45; Schefold Sagen 259-61. See also H.A. Shapiro, BABesch 56 (1981) 149-50; G.F. Pinney and R. Hamilton, AJA 86 (1982) 581-4; and M. Tiverios, Mia \"Krisis ton Oplon\" tou zographou tou Sulea (Athens 1985); but contrast D. Williams in F. Lissarrague and F. Thelamon (eds.), Image et céramique grecque (Rouen 1983) 139 f.n. 60. For a possible early representation of the quarrel see A.-N. Malagardis in Ancient Greek and Related Pottery, Copenhagen 390-406. See also now Beazley in Beazley Lectures 91-2 and Robertson Art of Vase-painting 87-9.\r\nVarious suggestions have been offered as to the identity of the two figures on the interior: see ARV2 369, 2; Robertson HGA 232; D. Williams, AntK 23 (1980) 140; Schefold Sagen 261; Robertson Art of Vasepainting 95-6. The petasos worn by the man recommends an identification as Odysseus; the girl might be Chryseis, as D.S. Robertson suggested following Iliad i 439-45 (quoted in ARV2 369, 2), but this would remove any close connection with the scenes on the exterior. Martin Robertson (HGA 232) suggested Tekmessa with either Teukros leading her away after the death of Ajax or Ajax himself with his newly won concubine. Schefold, however, has recently suggested Briseis, an additional prize that went to Odysseus with Achilles' arms. The pair seem to be conversing and the angle of the spear recalls that held by Patroklos on the Getty Iliupersis cup by Onesimos (D. Williams, Getty Vases 5 [1991] 58): it surely symbolises possession. As a result, Schefold's solution is perhaps the best. A very similar pair, only the man lacks the petasos, occurs on a fine cup by the Foundry Painter in Tarquinia (ARV2 405, 1), which Beazley identified as Agamemnon and Briseis.\r\nFor the chequer board pattern on the caul of the helmet cf. the Vienna skyphos (ARV2 380, 171) and see Beazley in C.B. iii, 36, where he suggests that on such helmets a patterned fabric might have been attached to the metal, although it now seems more likely that the bronze was actually painted (cf. H. Bron in M. True and J. Podany [eds.], Small Bronze Sculpture from the Ancient World [Malibu 1990] 189-94). The horizontal bands on the boots worn by Ajax and Odysseus on side A are probably caused by tying additional thongs around the soft boots to try to stop them sliding down: cf. Morrow Greek Footwear 65: she notes the same effect on the Parthenon Frieze, North XXXIX 122 (her pl. 45).","Bib references":"Vase \/ Catalogue of Vases in the British Museum; CVA British Museum 9 \/

type":"kylix","Museum number":"No: 1843,1103.11","Title":null,"Denomination":null,"Escapement":null,"Description":"Pottery: red-figured kylix. Description\r\nINTERIOR: man leading a woman (Odysseus and Briseis?). On the left a young woman, head lowered, is being led to the right. She wears a chiton and a himation (horizontal battlement border, dilute glaze vertical band, rows of dilute glaze dots) which is pulled up over the back of her head. She has a disc earring and a stephane with a row of sigmas. Her hair has a wash of dilute glaze and one long curly tress falls down behind her ear. Her mouth is slightly open and she must be exchanging words with the bearded man on the right, who similarly has his mouth open. Dressed in short chiton (dilute glaze folds), himation (rows of dots; battlement upper border) and petasos with red ties, he moves to the right, but turns his head back to look at the girl whom he leads, gripping her left wrist and hand in his right. He holds a spear in his left hand across his body, so that the point is above her head. There is dilute shading on his petasos at the top and above the beginning of the brim. His hair and beard are done with a dilute glaze wash and there are rows of dilute glaze dots on his neck. Border: stopt maeander (five-stroke, anticlockwise).\r\nEXTERIOR:  the Arms of Achilles. \r\nSide A (upper): quarrel over the arms of Achilles. On the far left a male in dotted chlamys holds the right arm of the figure in front of him (his head and part of his draped lower torso are missing). In front is a bearded man, probably Ajax, in boots (dilute glaze wash) with horizontal rolls and red ties and a dotted himation with a black border loosely draped over his arms, who attempts to move forward to the right. He holds a sword back in his right hand and a striped scabbard in his left. His pectorals and mid-line are enhanced with dilute glaze to indicate hair. A youth tries to push him back to the left. He has a chlamys with rows of dots in dilute glaze over his upper arms and turns his head back to the right. His hair is painted with dilute glaze. In the centre is a man in a long chiton (folds in dilute glaze) and a dotted himation with a battlement upper border; he is presumably Agamemnon. He moves to the left, but his arms are outstretched to left and right; his head, which is missing, was turned to the right, as the red ties from his headband on the left indicate. On the right a youth pushes to the right at a bearded man. The youth has a himation (black border, rows of dots) loosely draped over his shoulders; his hair is combed up in plait over his neck and he has a double red hair-band. The bearded man, probably Odysseus, in front of him endeavours to move to the left. In the struggle his himation (black border, rows of dots) has slipped from his right shoulder; he has just drawn his sword from its striped scabbard, which he holds in his left hand (hand and top of scabbard missing). He wears boots like those worn by Ajax: rolls above the ankles, red ties and dilute wash. His pectorals and mid-line are enhanced with dilute glaze to indicate hair and his lips are slightly parted. On the far right a bearded man moves to the left, a dotted himation (black border) over his shoulders, his right hand gripping the left shoulder of the man in front, his left hand probably the man's left wrist (both missing). His hair is combed up into a stiff fringe and his pectorals and mid-line are enhanced with dilute glaze to indicate hair.\r\nSide Β (lower): the vote for the arms of Achilles. On the far left stands Odysseus, dressed in a dotted himation with a battlement border (all the himatia on this side have such a border) and shoes. He leans on a knotty stick, his right hand on his hip under the drapery, his left hand up in front of his chest. His pectorals and mid-line are enhanced with dilute glaze to indicate hair. His mouth is open and he has a red apicate fillet. In front of him stands a youth, dressed in a himation with rows of dots and leaning on a knotty stick. He reaches down to the right with his right hand to place his pebble (not shown) on the plain block (dilute wash) in the centre. His hair is tied up in a plait over his neck and he has a double red fillet. His left hand is to be thought of as on top of his stick, near his right armpit. In front of him stands Athena who wears a chiton, himation, scaly snake-fringed aegis (dilute wash inside) and Attic helmet (dilute wash for caul; black neck-guard). She holds a spear upright in her right hand and gestures with her left hand. Her head (hair done with dilute wash) is turned to the right, but her right knee is bent and the leg is to be thought of as facing to the left. Her lower legs are obscured by the corner of the block. On the corner in front of the folds of her chiton are two rows of black pebbles, totalling twenty. In the centre stands a bearded man to the left, wearing a dotted himation and a red fillet. He twists his right shoulder in order to place a pebble (not shown) on the block which hides his lower legs. His left hand is on a knotty stick, which goes under his left armpit (lower part of stick not drawn). At the right corner of the block stands a youth in a himation with rows of dots and double red hair-band leaning back on a knotty stick. He also holds his right hand down to cast his vote. On the corner of the block in front of the folds of his himation are two rows of black pebbles, totalling eleven. On the right a bearded man in a dotted himation and shoes moves forward to the left to vote, but turns his head back to the right. He holds a knotty stick in his left hand across his body and holds his right hand out to vote (pebble not shown). He has a reserved head-band. On the far right stands Ajax, his dotted himation with its battlement border framing his head. He leans on a knotty stick (with groups of horizontal lines in dilute glaze on it), his head lowered in despair, his right hand to his forehead. He wears a red fillet.\r\nUnder handles: B\/A, Corinthian helmet (dilute glaze on cheek-piece; black on neck-piece; dilute glaze wash for fur frontiet; chequer-board pattern on caul) on top of a shield (dilute glaze hatching before rim); A\/B, pair of greaves (dilute glaze wash, elaborate modelling around knee-caps and a scroll on the calf, red ties above). Ground line: two reserved lines.\r\nRelief line contour throughout (except hair); dilute glaze for minor interior markings; thick reserved line inside lip, thin outside.","Producer name":"Attributed to: The Brygos Painter","School\/style":null,"State":null,"Authority":null,"Ethnic name (made by)":null,"Ethnic name (assoc)":null,"Culture":"Attic","Production date":"490BC-480BC","Production place":"Made in: Attica (Greece)","Find spot":"Excavated\/Findspot: Vulci","Materials":"pottery","Ware":"Red Figure","Type series":null,"Technique":"painted","Dimensions":"Diameter: 32.70 centimetres; Height: 13.80 millimetres; Weight: 1.05 kilograms; Width: 41.50 centimetres","Inscription":null,"Curators Comments":"CVA British Museum 9\r\nBibliography: Mus.

Beazley gave it to his Brygos Painter. It is an early mature work of the artist and may be compared with the Louvre Troilos cup and the Vatican arming cup (ARV2 369, 3; 373, 48). These seem to be slightly later than Vase E68 and they lead on to fully mature works such as the Vienna skyphos (ARV2 380, 171). There is both vitality and power in the drawing and a fine range of moods in the narrative. Bloesch has attributed the potting to Brygos.\r\nThe quarrel between Ajax and Odysseus for the arms of Achilles has been discussed recently by O. Touchefeu in LIMC i sv Aias I  p. 324-7; D. Williams, AntK 23 (1980) 137-45; Schefold Sagen 259-61. See also H.A. Shapiro, BABesch 56 (1981) 149-50; G.F. Pinney and R. Hamilton, AJA 86 (1982) 581-4; and M. Tiverios, Mia \"Krisis ton Oplon\" tou zographou tou Sulea (Athens 1985); but contrast D. Williams in F. Lissarrague and F. Thelamon (eds.), Image et céramique grecque (Rouen 1983) 139 f.n. 60. For a possible early representation of the quarrel see A.-N. Malagardis in Ancient Greek and Related Pottery, Copenhagen 390-406. See also now Beazley in Beazley Lectures 91-2 and Robertson Art of Vase-painting 87-9.\r\nVarious suggestions have been offered as to the identity of the two figures on the interior: see ARV2 369, 2; Robertson HGA 232; D. Williams, AntK 23 (1980) 140; Schefold Sagen 261; Robertson Art of Vasepainting 95-6. The petasos worn by the man recommends an identification as Odysseus; the girl might be Chryseis, as D.S. Robertson suggested following Iliad i 439-45 (quoted in ARV2 369, 2), but this would remove any close connection with the scenes on the exterior. Martin Robertson (HGA 232) suggested Tekmessa with either Teukros leading her away after the death of Ajax or Ajax himself with his newly won concubine. Schefold, however, has recently suggested Briseis, an additional prize that went to Odysseus with Achilles' arms. The pair seem to be conversing and the angle of the spear recalls that held by Patroklos on the Getty Iliupersis cup by Onesimos (D. Williams, Getty Vases 5 [1991] 58): it surely symbolises possession. As a result, Schefold's solution is perhaps the best. A very similar pair, only the man lacks the petasos, occurs on a fine cup by the Foundry Painter in Tarquinia (ARV2 405, 1), which Beazley identified as Agamemnon and Briseis.\r\nFor the chequer board pattern on the caul of the helmet cf. the Vienna skyphos (ARV2 380, 171) and see Beazley in C.B. iii, 36, where he suggests that on such helmets a patterned fabric might have been attached to the metal, although it now seems more likely that the bronze was actually painted (cf.

It lists the contents of each grave and votive deposit, along with their corresponding registration numbers; (4) the Kamiros index cards, written by Donald Bailey in the 1960’s.

(drinking cup) depicting a symposium.\r\nINTERIOR:  komast. A bearded komast moves to the right with head turned back to left. He wears a chlamys over his upper arms and a red apicate fillet in his hair. He holds a cup back in his right hand and a knotty stick across his body in his left. Relief line for vertical strokes of fringe over forehead and for horizontal lines of hair tied up at back (relief line fringe for beard); dilute glaze line above and below eye. Preliminary sketch indicates that the chlamys was intended to be longer on the right. Border: alternating false maeander (twelve-stroke, alternately clockwise and anticlockwise) and blackened cross-square.\r\nEXTERIOR:  symposium. Side A (lower): three banqueters on couches attended by two boys. On the couch on the left a bearded man reclines to the left, his head turned back to the right. He wears a himation over his left shoulder and around his waist and legs and a red apicate fillet in his hair. He rests against a folded cushion decorated with pairs of stripes, while he grips a cup in his left hand and holds out his right hand palm upward as if holding another. Above him hang two cups, seen from underneath, and a flat-bottomed oinochoe. His couch rests on a dais, the corner of which is visible on the left, and in front of it (ie. alongside) is a three-legged table on which are three red garlands.\r\nIn front of the left hand end of the central couch stands a naked boy with a red fillet in his hair. He holds an oinochoe in his right hand and stretches out his left hand towards the symposiast on the central couch. Here a bearded man reclines to the left (cushion decorated with a pair of stripes and a stripe flanked by pairs of lines). He holds out a cup high in his right hand; his left hand is empty. He wears a himation in the same manner as the first symposiast, but has a thick reserved fillet (alternately vertical line and rows of dots at each bunching) in his hair. Above him and the boy hang two footless oinochoai and a cup seen from underneath. Alongside his couch is a three-legged table over which hang three red garlands.\r\nThe couch on the right is seen in end view from the back. On it reclines a bearded man with a himation round his waist and a red apicate fillet in his hair. He is seen from the back, his left elbow resting on his cushion and his raised right knee splayed out to the right. He holds a cup up to his lips in his left hand and gestures with his right to the boy who stands between him and the central couch. Either side of the end of the couch project the ends of his striped cushion. Alongside the couch is a three-legged table, also seen from the end, the two legs in profile in the foreground, the third in back view beyond. The naked boy attendant who stands on the left of the couch, behind the table, has a frontal torso and left leg. His hair has a long straight fringe of relief lines over his neck. He holds an oinochoe in his left hand, tipped down so that the trefoil mouth is shown foreshortened. He gestures with his right hand as he looks at the symposiast. Above these two figures are two cups seen from underneath and a small foodess oinochoe.\r\nSide Β (upper): three couches and one boy attendant. The couch and its occupant on the left repeats the form of the central couch on side A, although the symposiast's himation has a line border and his cushion pairs of lines. As on the first couch on side A, the corner of the dais is visible. Above this couch hang two cups seen from underneath and a footed oinochoe.\r\nAt the left hand end of the central couch stands a naked boy with a red hair-band, holding a small chytra in his right hand as he holds up his left hand. The bearded man on this couch repeats the scheme of the central couch on side A, save that here he holds a cup in his left hand and extends his right arm out towards the boy. From the fingers of his right hand hangs a red circlet. Above hang a footless oinochoe, a cup seen from underneath and a small chytra.\r\nThe couch on the right is seen from behind, as on side A. The man here, however, holds a cup in his left hand as he leans on his left elbow, and his right hand is held out further to the left (no hair-band). The corner of the dais is visible and there is a three-legged table alongside the couch, but no attendant, nor are there any red garlands on the table and the cushion is plain. Above hang two cups seen from underneath and a small footless oinochoe.\r\nAt either handle: floral complex with a circumscribed palmette either side of the handles and a large and a small palmette addorsed under the handles; spiral terminals and dots.\r\nGround line: single reserved line.

Douris worked with a number of potters but most of his career was spent working with the potter Python. He is understood to have been active beginning in the final years of the 6th century BC until circa 470BC.  His pieces have been separated into four distinct periods and BM 1843,1103.15 fits into his Middle Period, to which almost half his work belongs. Cups from the Middle Period tend to be decorated around the tondo with a distinctive maeander and cross-square pattern and the handle zones have elaborate palmettes and tendrils.  Most of the figural decorations on vases from his Middle Period can be placed into a small number of themes of which symposia feature frequently.’\r\n‘Unlike his earlier pieces where revellers reclined primarily on cushions, symposiasts  are now depicted on couches and the arrangement he prefers on the exterior surface of cups is the composition of two couches in profile and the third from behind, as is seen on this cup.  Whilst he was not the most innovative of painters, Douris was an extremely accomplished vase-painter; his works were evidently in demand and influenced a number of later Classical artists.’\r\n'Large quantities of Greek vases were imported into ancient Etruria with a great many being found in the 19th century, particularly when tombs were opened up in the extensive necropoleis at Vulci, the source of this kylix.  At the time, these fine Greek vases were thought to be Etruscan and much of the interior décor and pottery which they inspired was called ‘Etruscan’.  Ironically much of the truly Etruscan pottery, a great deal of it bucchero, was trampled underfoot during these ‘excavations’ as it did not have sufficient monetary value.'\r\n(Bergeron in Bruschetti et al. 2014, III.76a-b)\r\nSee also comments of Blanchard who contrasts the restrained homoeroticism of this symposium scene with one shown on a vase in Turin depicting what appears to be a homosexual orgy (2018, 105-107 and fig. 64, 110 note 33).   \r\nBibliography:\r\nBruschetti, P. et al 2014, Seduzione Etrusca.

Robson (eds), Sex in antiquity: exploring gender and sexuality in the ancient world (Abingdon: Routledge),  99-114.; [Text from CVA British Museum 9  Great Britain 17]\r\nAll the cups held by the symposiasts have offset lips and the stem of the foot does not continue the contour of the bowl. They may be of metal or of clay, if of clay perhaps of the so-called Acrocup type (see most recently K. Vierneisel and B. Kaeser [eds.], Kunst der Schale - Kultur des Trinkens [Munich 1990] 180-1). The presence of chytra is also ambiguous, for, although chytra are regularly cooking pots of coarse fabric, they were sometimes imitated in black glaze and bronze (e.g. GR 1864.10-7.336 [black glaze]; GR 1882.10-19.18 [bronze]). See further Agora xii 224-6. Chytra are also held by the servant boys on three other Dourian symposia (ARV2 432, 55 and 5 8; 438, 140; 792, 5 3) and are to be seen hung up on a head kantharos, a late work of Douris (Swiss private, ex Holger Termer, Galerie Neuendorf: Kunst der Antike [Hamburg 1978] no. 10; see also J.R. Guy, Arts in Virginia 21:2 [1981] 6 and 8). The appearance of these small chytra at symposia suggests the serving of warmed wine, perhaps heavily spiced.\r\nCups hung up and viewed from underneath seem to have been particularly liked by Douris. They recur in symposium and komos scenes on a. good number of Dourian cups: see Vase E50 and Vase E53; and ARV2 432, 53-6; 436, 98; 438, 140; Centre Island, private. They also occur in a school scene (ARV2 431, 48), in scenes involving warriors (ARV2 435, 92-3 and 436, 110) and in what seems to be a mixed conversation scene (ARV2 800, 7). The idea is sometimes imitated by contemporary painters (e.g. Vase E70) and Early Classical artists (e.g. ARV2 258, 21, Copenhagen Painter; ARV2 567, 3, Leningrad Painter), but it also recurs later (e.g. Vienna IV 824: CVA 2 pl. 89, 1-3). There can be no doubt that cups were in fact hung up on hooks on the wall (cf. the Tomba dei Rilievi, where even the hooks are shown: H. Blanck and G. Proietti, La Tomba dei Rilievi di Cerveteri [Rome 1986] pl. 6a, 15 c).\r\nThe symposium is first represented by Douris on the very early cup in the Vatican (ARV2 427, 2; compare also fragments in a Centre Island private collection, attributed by D. von Bothmer) and here the participants recline on the ground-line in the manner of many late sixth-century symposium scenes. Participants reclining on a couch set on a dais and accompanied by a table first appear in the works of Douris on a 'bare' cup in the Louvre (ARV2 430, 36 with 345, 68 and 434, 82; see Beaz\/ey Add2 236). This becomes the norm on middle cups (e.g. ARV2 432, 53 and 5 5 and 57) and was imitated by Douris' followers (e.g. ARV2 432, 58 and ARV2 438, 140; both now attributed by J.R. Guy to his Painter of London Ε55; and two earlyish works of the Euaion Painter, ARV2 792, 48 and 51).\r\nFor the motif of the couch seen from one end, compare Vase E50, with commentary, and Florence 3922 (ARV2 432, 55). For the thick reserved headbands, see Vase E54. On boys at symposia see J. Bremmer in Sympotica 135-48.\r\nThe graffiti appear to be Etruscan: they may have recorded ownership.\r\nCVA British Museum 9\r\nBibliography: Mus.

(drinking cup) depicting a symposium.\r\nINTERIOR:  komast. A bearded komast moves to the right with head turned back to left. He wears a chlamys over his upper arms and a red apicate fillet in his hair. He holds a cup back in his right hand and a knotty stick across his body in his left. Relief line for vertical strokes of fringe over forehead and for horizontal lines of hair tied up at back (relief line fringe for beard); dilute glaze line above and below eye. Preliminary sketch indicates that the chlamys was intended to be longer on the right. Border: alternating false maeander (twelve-stroke, alternately clockwise and anticlockwise) and blackened cross-square.\r\nEXTERIOR:  symposium. Side A (lower): three banqueters on couches attended by two boys. On the couch on the left a bearded man reclines to the left, his head turned back to the right. He wears a himation over his left shoulder and around his waist and legs and a red apicate fillet in his hair. He rests against a folded cushion decorated with pairs of stripes, while he grips a cup in his left hand and holds out his right hand palm upward as if holding another. Above him hang two cups, seen from underneath, and a flat-bottomed oinochoe. His couch rests on a dais, the corner of which is visible on the left, and in front of it (ie. alongside) is a three-legged table on which are three red garlands.\r\nIn front of the left hand end of the central couch stands a naked boy with a red fillet in his hair. He holds an oinochoe in his right hand and stretches out his left hand towards the symposiast on the central couch. Here a bearded man reclines to the left (cushion decorated with a pair of stripes and a stripe flanked by pairs of lines). He holds out a cup high in his right hand; his left hand is empty. He wears a himation in the same manner as the first symposiast, but has a thick reserved fillet (alternately vertical line and rows of dots at each bunching) in his hair. Above him and the boy hang two footless oinochoai and a cup seen from underneath. Alongside his couch is a three-legged table over which hang three red garlands.\r\nThe couch on the right is seen in end view from the back. On it reclines a bearded man with a himation round his waist and a red apicate fillet in his hair. He is seen from the back, his left elbow resting on his cushion and his raised right knee splayed out to the right. He holds a cup up to his lips in his left hand and gestures with his right to the boy who stands between him and the central couch. Either side of the end of the couch project the ends of his striped cushion. Alongside the couch is a three-legged table, also seen from the end, the two legs in profile in the foreground, the third in back view beyond. The naked boy attendant who stands on the left of the couch, behind the table, has a frontal torso and left leg. His hair has a long straight fringe of relief lines over his neck. He holds an oinochoe in his left hand, tipped down so that the trefoil mouth is shown foreshortened. He gestures with his right hand as he looks at the symposiast. Above these two figures are two cups seen from underneath and a small foodess oinochoe.\r\nSide Β (upper): three couches and one boy attendant. The couch and its occupant on the left repeats the form of the central couch on side A, although the symposiast's himation has a line border and his cushion pairs of lines. As on the first couch on side A, the corner of the dais is visible. Above this couch hang two cups seen from underneath and a footed oinochoe.\r\nAt the left hand end of the central couch stands a naked boy with a red hair-band, holding a small chytra in his right hand as he holds up his left hand. The bearded man on this couch repeats the scheme of the central couch on side A, save that here he holds a cup in his left hand and extends his right arm out towards the boy. From the fingers of his right hand hangs a red circlet. Above hang a footless oinochoe, a cup seen from underneath and a small chytra.\r\nThe couch on the right is seen from behind, as on side A. The man here, however, holds a cup in his left hand as he leans on his left elbow, and his right hand is held out further to the left (no hair-band). The corner of the dais is visible and there is a three-legged table alongside the couch, but no attendant, nor are there any red garlands on the table and the cushion is plain. Above hang two cups seen from underneath and a small footless oinochoe.\r\nAt either handle: floral complex with a circumscribed palmette either side of the handles and a large and a small palmette addorsed under the handles; spiral terminals and dots.\r\nGround line: single reserved line. Graffiti under foot\r\nRelief line contours throughout (double for hair, except on AI); dilute glaze for minor interior markings; reserved line inside and outside lip; added red for inscriptions.\r\nInscriptions on interior and exterior.","Producer name":"Painted by: Douris","School\/style":null,"State":null,"Authority":null,"Ethnic name (made by)":null,"Ethnic name (assoc)":null,"Culture":"Attic","Production date":"485BC-480BC (circa)","Production place":"Made in: Attica (Greece)","Find spot":"Excavated\/Findspot: Vulci (said to be from)","Materials":"pottery","Ware":"Red Figure","Type series":null,"Technique":"painted","Dimensions":"Diameter: 39.80 centimetres with handles ; Diameter: 31.60 centimetres without handles ; Height: 12.60 centimetres","Inscription":"Inscription type: inscription Inscription language: Greek Inscription script: Greek Inscription quoted: Interior: ΛΟΡΙΣΕΛΡAΦΣEN (retr.)\r\nExterior, lower and upper: KALΟΣ KALΟΣ\r\nExterior, upper: Inscription note: Douris uses delta with a dot representing the lower line.; Inscription type: owner's mark Inscription position: under foot Inscription script: Etruscan Inscription note: Graffito, three letters, retrograde; the first heta?","Curators Comments":"‘The signature on the vase identifies the painter as Douris. Douris worked with a number of potters but most of his career was spent working with the potter Python. He is understood to have been active beginning in the final years of the 6th century BC until circa 470BC.  His pieces have been separated into four distinct periods and BM 1843,1103.15 fits into his Middle Period, to which almost half his work belongs. Cups from the Middle Period tend to be decorated around the tondo with a distinctive maeander and cross-square pattern and the handle zones have elaborate palmettes and tendrils.  Most of the figural decorations on vases from his Middle Period can be placed into a small number of themes of which symposia feature frequently.’\r\n‘Unlike his earlier pieces where revellers reclined primarily on cushions, symposiasts  are now depicted on couches and the arrangement he prefers on the exterior surface of cups is the composition of two couches in profile and the third from behind, as is seen on this cup.  Whilst he was not the most innovative of painters, Douris was an extremely accomplished vase-painter; his works were evidently in demand and influenced a number of later Classical artists.’\r\n'Large quantities of Greek vases were imported into ancient Etruria with a great many being found in the 19th century, particularly when tombs were opened up in the extensive necropoleis at Vulci, the source of this kylix.  At the time, these fine Greek vases were thought to be Etruscan and much of the interior décor and pottery which they inspired was called ‘Etruscan’.  Ironically much of the truly Etruscan pottery, a great deal of it bucchero, was trampled underfoot during these ‘excavations’ as it did not have sufficient monetary value.'\r\n(Bergeron in Bruschetti et al. 2014, III.76a-b)\r\nSee also comments of Blanchard who contrasts the restrained homoeroticism of this symposium scene with one shown on a vase in Turin depicting what appears to be a homosexual orgy (2018, 105-107 and fig. 64, 110 note 33).   \r\nBibliography:\r\nBruschetti, P. et al 2014, Seduzione Etrusca.

Robson (eds), Sex in antiquity: exploring gender and sexuality in the ancient world (Abingdon: Routledge),  99-114.; [Text from CVA British Museum 9  Great Britain 17]\r\nAll the cups held by the symposiasts have offset lips and the stem of the foot does not continue the contour of the bowl. They may be of metal or of clay, if of clay perhaps of the so-called Acrocup type (see most recently K. Vierneisel and B. Kaeser [eds.], Kunst der Schale - Kultur des Trinkens [Munich 1990] 180-1). The presence of chytra is also ambiguous, for, although chytra are regularly cooking pots of coarse fabric, they were sometimes imitated in black glaze and bronze (e.g. GR 1864.10-7.336 [black glaze]; GR 1882.10-19.18 [bronze]). See further Agora xii 224-6. Chytra are also held by the servant boys on three other Dourian symposia (ARV2 432, 55 and 5 8; 438, 140; 792, 5 3) and are to be seen hung up on a head kantharos, a late work of Douris (Swiss private, ex Holger Termer, Galerie Neuendorf: Kunst der Antike [Hamburg 1978] no. 10; see also J.R. Guy, Arts in Virginia 21:2 [1981] 6 and 8). The appearance of these small chytra at symposia suggests the serving of warmed wine, perhaps heavily spiced.\r\nCups hung up and viewed from underneath seem to have been particularly liked by Douris. They recur in symposium and komos scenes on a. good number of Dourian cups: see Vase E50 and Vase E53; and ARV2 432, 53-6; 436, 98; 438, 140; Centre Island, private. They also occur in a school scene (ARV2 431, 48), in scenes involving warriors (ARV2 435, 92-3 and 436, 110) and in what seems to be a mixed conversation scene (ARV2 800, 7). The idea is sometimes imitated by contemporary painters (e.g. Vase E70) and Early Classical artists (e.g. ARV2 258, 21, Copenhagen Painter; ARV2 567, 3, Leningrad Painter), but it also recurs later (e.g. Vienna IV 824: CVA 2 pl. 89, 1-3). There can be no doubt that cups were in fact hung up on hooks on the wall (cf. the Tomba dei Rilievi, where even the hooks are shown: H. Blanck and G. Proietti, La Tomba dei Rilievi di Cerveteri [Rome 1986] pl. 6a, 15 c).\r\nThe symposium is first represented by Douris on the very early cup in the Vatican (ARV2 427, 2; compare also fragments in a Centre Island private collection, attributed by D. von Bothmer) and here the participants recline on the ground-line in the manner of many late sixth-century symposium scenes. Participants reclining on a couch set on a dais and accompanied by a table first appear in the works of Douris on a 'bare' cup in the Louvre (ARV2 430, 36 with 345, 68 and 434, 82; see Beaz\/ey Add2 236). This becomes the norm on middle cups (e.g. ARV2 432, 53 and 5 5 and 57) and was imitated by Douris' followers (e.g. ARV2 432, 58 and ARV2 438, 140; both now attributed by J.R. Guy to his Painter of London Ε55; and two earlyish works of the Euaion Painter, ARV2 792, 48 and 51).\r\nFor the motif of the couch seen from one end, compare Vase E50, with commentary, and Florence 3922 (ARV2 432, 55). For the thick reserved headbands, see Vase E54. On boys at symposia see J. Bremmer in Sympotica 135-48.\r\nThe graffiti appear to be Etruscan: they may have recorded ownership.\r\nCVA British Museum 9\r\nBibliography: Mus.

(drinking cup) depicting a symposium.\r\nINTERIOR:  komast. A bearded komast moves to the right with head turned back to left. He wears a chlamys over his upper arms and a red apicate fillet in his hair. He holds a cup back in his right hand and a knotty stick across his body in his left. Relief line for vertical strokes of fringe over forehead and for horizontal lines of hair tied up at back (relief line fringe for beard); dilute glaze line above and below eye. Preliminary sketch indicates that the chlamys was intended to be longer on the right. Border: alternating false maeander (twelve-stroke, alternately clockwise and anticlockwise) and blackened cross-square.\r\nEXTERIOR:  symposium. Side A (lower): three banqueters on couches attended by two boys. On the couch on the left a bearded man reclines to the left, his head turned back to the right. He wears a himation over his left shoulder and around his waist and legs and a red apicate fillet in his hair. He rests against a folded cushion decorated with pairs of stripes, while he grips a cup in his left hand and holds out his right hand palm upward as if holding another. Above him hang two cups, seen from underneath, and a flat-bottomed oinochoe. His couch rests on a dais, the corner of which is visible on the left, and in front of it (ie. alongside) is a three-legged table on which are three red garlands.\r\nIn front of the left hand end of the central couch stands a naked boy with a red fillet in his hair. He holds an oinochoe in his right hand and stretches out his left hand towards the symposiast on the central couch. Here a bearded man reclines to the left (cushion decorated with a pair of stripes and a stripe flanked by pairs of lines). He holds out a cup high in his right hand; his left hand is empty. He wears a himation in the same manner as the first symposiast, but has a thick reserved fillet (alternately vertical line and rows of dots at each bunching) in his hair. Above him and the boy hang two footless oinochoai and a cup seen from underneath. Alongside his couch is a three-legged table over which hang three red garlands.\r\nThe couch on the right is seen in end view from the back. On it reclines a bearded man with a himation round his waist and a red apicate fillet in his hair. He is seen from the back, his left elbow resting on his cushion and his raised right knee splayed out to the right. He holds a cup up to his lips in his left hand and gestures with his right to the boy who stands between him and the central couch. Either side of the end of the couch project the ends of his striped cushion. Alongside the couch is a three-legged table, also seen from the end, the two legs in profile in the foreground, the third in back view beyond. The naked boy attendant who stands on the left of the couch, behind the table, has a frontal torso and left leg. His hair has a long straight fringe of relief lines over his neck. He holds an oinochoe in his left hand, tipped down so that the trefoil mouth is shown foreshortened. He gestures with his right hand as he looks at the symposiast. Above these two figures are two cups seen from underneath and a small foodess oinochoe.\r\nSide Β (upper): three couches and one boy attendant. The couch and its occupant on the left repeats the form of the central couch on side A, although the symposiast's himation has a line border and his cushion pairs of lines. As on the first couch on side A, the corner of the dais is visible. Above this couch hang two cups seen from underneath and a footed oinochoe.\r\nAt the left hand end of the central couch stands a naked boy with a red hair-band, holding a small chytra in his right hand as he holds up his left hand. The bearded man on this couch repeats the scheme of the central couch on side A, save that here he holds a cup in his left hand and extends his right arm out towards the boy. From the fingers of his right hand hangs a red circlet. Above hang a footless oinochoe, a cup seen from underneath and a small chytra.\r\nThe couch on the right is seen from behind, as on side A. The man here, however, holds a cup in his left hand as he leans on his left elbow, and his right hand is held out further to the left (no hair-band). The corner of the dais is visible and there is a three-legged table alongside the couch, but no attendant, nor are there any red garlands on the table and the cushion is plain.

Douris worked with a number of potters but most of his career was spent working with the potter Python. He is understood to have been active beginning in the final years of the 6th century BC until circa 470BC.  His pieces have been separated into four distinct periods and BM 1843,1103.15 fits into his Middle Period, to which almost half his work belongs. Cups from the Middle Period tend to be decorated around the tondo with a distinctive maeander and cross-square pattern and the handle zones have elaborate palmettes and tendrils.  Most of the figural decorations on vases from his Middle Period can be placed into a small number of themes of which symposia feature frequently.’\r\n‘Unlike his earlier pieces where revellers reclined primarily on cushions, symposiasts  are now depicted on couches and the arrangement he prefers on the exterior surface of cups is the composition of two couches in profile and the third from behind, as is seen on this cup.  Whilst he was not the most innovative of painters, Douris was an extremely accomplished vase-painter; his works were evidently in demand and influenced a number of later Classical artists.’\r\n'Large quantities of Greek vases were imported into ancient Etruria with a great many being found in the 19th century, particularly when tombs were opened up in the extensive necropoleis at Vulci, the source of this kylix.  At the time, these fine Greek vases were thought to be Etruscan and much of the interior décor and pottery which they inspired was called ‘Etruscan’.  Ironically much of the truly Etruscan pottery, a great deal of it bucchero, was trampled underfoot during these ‘excavations’ as it did not have sufficient monetary value.'\r\n(Bergeron in Bruschetti et al. 2014, III.76a-b)\r\nSee also comments of Blanchard who contrasts the restrained homoeroticism of this symposium scene with one shown on a vase in Turin depicting what appears to be a homosexual orgy (2018, 105-107 and fig. 64, 110 note 33).   \r\nBibliography:\r\nBruschetti, P. et al 2014, Seduzione Etrusca. Dai segreti di Holkham Hall alle meraviglie del British Museum (Cortona: Scira) \r\nBlanchard, A. 2018, 'Fantasy and the homosexual orgy. Unearthing the sexual scripts of ancient Athens', in M. Masterson,  N. Rabinowitz, J. Robson (eds), Sex in antiquity: exploring gender and sexuality in the ancient world (Abingdon: Routledge),  99-114.; [Text from CVA British Museum 9  Great Britain 17]\r\nAll the cups held by the symposiasts have offset lips and the stem of the foot does not continue the contour of the bowl. They may be of metal or of clay, if of clay perhaps of the so-called Acrocup type (see most recently K. Vierneisel and B. Kaeser [eds.], Kunst der Schale - Kultur des Trinkens [Munich 1990] 180-1). The presence of chytra is also ambiguous, for, although chytra are regularly cooking pots of coarse fabric, they were sometimes imitated in black glaze and bronze (e.g. GR 1864.10-7.336 [black glaze]; GR 1882.10-19.18 [bronze]). See further Agora xii 224-6. Chytra are also held by the servant boys on three other Dourian symposia (ARV2 432, 55 and 5 8; 438, 140; 792, 5 3) and are to be seen hung up on a head kantharos, a late work of Douris (Swiss private, ex Holger Termer, Galerie Neuendorf: Kunst der Antike [Hamburg 1978] no. 10; see also J.R. Guy, Arts in Virginia 21:2 [1981] 6 and 8). The appearance of these small chytra at symposia suggests the serving of warmed wine, perhaps heavily spiced.\r\nCups hung up and viewed from underneath seem to have been particularly liked by Douris. They recur in symposium and komos scenes on a. good number of Dourian cups: see Vase E50 and Vase E53; and ARV2 432, 53-6; 436, 98; 438, 140; Centre Island, private. They also occur in a school scene (ARV2 431, 48), in scenes involving warriors (ARV2 435, 92-3 and 436, 110) and in what seems to be a mixed conversation scene (ARV2 800, 7). The idea is sometimes imitated by contemporary painters (e.g. Vase E70) and Early Classical artists (e.g. ARV2 258, 21, Copenhagen Painter; ARV2 567, 3, Leningrad Painter), but it also recurs later (e.g. Vienna IV 824: CVA 2 pl. 89, 1-3). There can be no doubt that cups were in fact hung up on hooks on the wall (cf. the Tomba dei Rilievi, where even the hooks are shown: H. Blanck and G. Proietti, La Tomba dei Rilievi di Cerveteri [Rome 1986] pl. 6a, 15 c).\r\nThe symposium is first represented by Douris on the very early cup in the Vatican (ARV2 427, 2; compare also fragments in a Centre Island private collection, attributed by D. von Bothmer) and here the participants recline on the ground-line in the manner of many late sixth-century symposium scenes. Participants reclining on a couch set on a dais and accompanied by a table first appear in the works of Douris on a 'bare' cup in the Louvre (ARV2 430, 36 with 345, 68 and 434, 82; see Beaz\/ey Add2 236). This becomes the norm on middle cups (e.g. ARV2 432, 53 and 5 5 and 57) and was imitated by Douris' followers (e.g. ARV2 432, 58 and ARV2 438, 140; both now attributed by J.R. Guy to his Painter of London Ε55; and two earlyish works of the Euaion Painter, ARV2 792, 48 and 51).\r\nFor the motif of the couch seen from one end, compare Vase E50, with commentary, and Florence 3922 (ARV2 432, 55). For the thick reserved headbands, see Vase E54. On boys at symposia see J. Bremmer in Sympotica 135-48.\r\nThe graffiti appear to be Etruscan: they may have recorded ownership.\r\nCVA British Museum 9\r\nBibliography: Mus.

The left foot of Oedipus rests on the back of the monster's head; the profile of its face is still traceable, but the white colour is here worn off. Above Oedipus is inscribed his name, half on each side of the column, ΟΙΔΙ ΠΟΥΣ, Οίδίπους. Over the Sphinx, Apollo is seated to left, on his mantle spread on high ground; he has long wavy hair wreathed with laurel, and a long laurel branch against his right shoulder; an end of his mantle passes over his right thigh; he leans on his left elbow, looking round in three-quarter face to right. Beside him is inscribed his name, ΑΡΟΛΛΩΝ, 'Απόλλων. On the left of Oedipus Athene stands looking on, with spear resting against right shoulder and left hand resting on the edge of her shield (seen in perspective), which has for device a laurel-wreath within an edging of dots. She wears a long chiton with apoptygma, aegis, necklace and belt of beads, earrings, bracelets, ana a helmet with raised cheek-pieces; beside her on right, ΑΘΗΝΑ, 'Αθήνα. Behind her on left stands Aeneas, a beardless youth in a chlamys, with spear resting against his left shoulder, leaning forward with his left foot raised on higher ground; beside him a tree, and over him his name, AINEAΣ, Αίνέας. On the right of Apollo are the Dioscuri. Castor stands in three-quarter face to left, with left hand on his hip and holding upright in his right a spear; a short mantle passes over his right elbow and left shoulder and a sword hangs at his side. Over him his name, KAΣTΩΡ, Κάστωρ. Behind him is Polydeukes, seated to right looking round; his mantle is arranged like that of Apollo, and his spear rests against his left shoulder. Over him, his name, ΠΟΛΥΔΕΥΚΗΣ, Πολυδευκης. This figure, Aeneas, and Oedipus all wear open-work sandals.\r\nLate fine style. Gilding on a raised surface is used for the helmet, aegis, and shield of Athene, the spear-heads, jewellery, wings of the Sphinx, and centres of palmettes. White, with details in brown, for the flesh and drapery of Athene, and the body of the Sphinx. Purple for inscriptions. Inner markings in very fine lines of black glaze. Ground-lines very lightly incised in the black glaze. Below, a band of egg pattern, over which the feet of the Sphinx project. Above, a row of upright palmettes; round the neck, tongue pattern. Below the handle, two palmettes superimposed, with one branching on each side.","Producer name":"Attributed to the Manner of: The Meidias Painter","School\/style":null,"State":null,"Authority":null,"Ethnic name (made by)":null,"Ethnic name (assoc)":null,"Culture":"Attic","Production date":"420BC-400BC","Production place":"Made in: Attica (Greece)","Find spot":"Excavated\/Findspot: Marion-Arsinoe (historic)","Materials":"pottery; gold","Ware":"Red Figure","Type series":null,"Technique":"painted; gilded","Dimensions":"Height: 19.05 centimetres","Inscription":null,"Curators Comments":"BM Cat.

Over the Sphinx, Apollo is seated to left, on his mantle spread on high ground; he has long wavy hair wreathed with laurel, and a long laurel branch against his right shoulder; an end of his mantle passes over his right thigh; he leans on his left elbow, looking round in three-quarter face to right. Beside him is inscribed his name, ΑΡΟΛΛΩΝ, 'Απόλλων. On the left of Oedipus Athene stands looking on, with spear resting against right shoulder and left hand resting on the edge of her shield (seen in perspective), which has for device a laurel-wreath within an edging of dots. She wears a long chiton with apoptygma, aegis, necklace and belt of beads, earrings, bracelets, ana a helmet with raised cheek-pieces; beside her on right, ΑΘΗΝΑ, 'Αθήνα. Behind her on left stands Aeneas, a beardless youth in a chlamys, with spear resting against his left shoulder, leaning forward with his left foot raised on higher ground; beside him a tree, and over him his name, AINEAΣ, Αίνέας. On the right of Apollo are the Dioscuri. Castor stands in three-quarter face to left, with left hand on his hip and holding upright in his right a spear; a short mantle passes over his right elbow and left shoulder and a sword hangs at his side. Over him his name, KAΣTΩΡ, Κάστωρ. Behind him is Polydeukes, seated to right looking round; his mantle is arranged like that of Apollo, and his spear rests against his left shoulder. Over him, his name, ΠΟΛΥΔΕΥΚΗΣ, Πολυδευκης. This figure, Aeneas, and Oedipus all wear open-work sandals.\r\nLate fine style. Gilding on a raised surface is used for the helmet, aegis, and shield of Athene, the spear-heads, jewellery, wings of the Sphinx, and centres of palmettes. White, with details in brown, for the flesh and drapery of Athene, and the body of the Sphinx. Purple for inscriptions. Inner markings in very fine lines of black glaze. Ground-lines very lightly incised in the black glaze. Below, a band of egg pattern, over which the feet of the Sphinx project. Above, a row of upright palmettes; round the neck, tongue pattern. Below the handle, two palmettes superimposed, with one branching on each side.","Producer name":"Attributed to the Manner of: The Meidias Painter","School\/style":null,"State":null,"Authority":null,"Ethnic name (made by)":null,"Ethnic name (assoc)":null,"Culture":"Attic","Production date":"420BC-400BC","Production place":"Made in: Attica (Greece)","Find spot":"Excavated\/Findspot: Marion-Arsinoe (historic)","Materials":"pottery; gold","Ware":"Red Figure","Type series":null,"Technique":"painted; gilded","Dimensions":"Height: 19.05 centimetres","Inscription":null,"Curators Comments":"BM Cat.
